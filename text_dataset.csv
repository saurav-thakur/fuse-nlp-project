As we discussed, I am enclosing a proposal on the use of videocassettes as an advertising and promotional vehicle for RJR Nabisco. There are several major areas for consideratio! I. Direct Movie Advertising - Moonstruck (or other titles: The August release of ""Moonstruck"" on videocasesette (estimated to ship some 300-400,000 units) presents a rare opportunity: RJR Nabisco can place an ad for one of its food products on a film that just won three Academy Awards, has grossed over $71 million at the box office, and is the ""Best Picture"" (meaning best- suited among the Academy Award nominees) for the home video market. ""Moonstruck"" has broad appeal, high recognition and promotes strong, warm family values. It is an altogether pleasant viewing experience (totally inoffensive), which would be an appropriate associative link for an RJR Nabisco product. II. Promotion In the area of promotion, we are exploring the following types of offers with major advertisers: a) the offer of one cassette per month from our library of titles, for 12 months, as a premium to buyers of certain frequently used products; there isa ""buy-in"" of a minimum number of so many units 2106 O1Z0S",0

Received December 22, 1992; Revised and Accepted March 18, 1993 ABSTRACT We describe a new exonuclease-based method for joining and/or constructing two or more DNA molecules. DNA fragments containing ends complementary to those of a vector or another independent molecules were generated by the polymerase chain. reaction. The 3’ ends of these ‘molecules as well as the vector DNA were then recessed by exonuclease activity and annealed in an orientation-determined manner via thelr complemen- tary single-stranded regions. This recombinant DNA an be transformed directly into bacteria without a further ligase-dependent reaction. Using this approach, We have constructed recombinant DNA molecules rapidly, efficiently and directionally. This method can effectively replace conventional protocols for PCR cloning, PCR SOEing, DNA subcloning and site- directed mutagenesis. INTRODUCTION ‘The use ofthe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in nucleic acid esearch has provided a convenient way to amplify and construct, genes. In most cases, subcloning of PCR products is required for further manipulation and generally involves the incorporation of restriction sites a the ends of PCR products (1,2), or blunt. ended ligation of PCR products into the vector (3). However, cloning of PCR products is often less straightforward than anticipated. The main problems which need tobe solved in blunt ended cloning of PCR products include the removal of extra ‘nucleotides added tothe 3” ends by Taq DNA polymerase (3,4), the prevention of non-recombinant backgrounds, and the low efficiency of the blunt-end ligation reaction, The T/A cloning system (Invitrogen) has been used to overcome the extra ‘nucleotide problem at the 3” end but an extra dAMP is ‘automatically inserted. This generates. additional problems especialy in expression studies a twill alter the reading fame. Cohesive end cloning (provided by the incorporation of restriction sites at the 5’ end of PCR primers) is a good altemative to blunt tend cloning. Nonetheless, both methods require several steps of DNA fragment purification, ligase-dependent ligation and colony selection to determine the correct orientation of the insert and ate labor intensive, time consuming and/or of low efficiency. Strategies for ligase-free cloning of PCR products have been developed to overcome some of these problems. The recombinant circle PCR (RCPCR) technique generates circular DNA through hhterologous annealing of sequence-overlapped ends on different PCR products (5,6). These circular DNA forms can be transformed direty into bacteria without a ligation procedure. However, this method requires either multiple sets of PCR primers ‘or PCR reamplificaton of  sequence-overlapped ‘molecules to splice insert and vector DNA togethet (7). Also in these applications, both insert and vector DNA must be amplified. Vector DNA amplification adds to the limitation on the size ofthe DNA fragment that can be amplified by Taq DNA. polymerase. An alterate strategy isto create sequence specific, single-stranded ends on both PCR products of inset and vector ends (6~10), then splice them through a sequence homologous annealing process. In most applications, single-stranded ends are generated by the 3’ to 5"" exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase (8,9) with the overlapped sequence specifically Sesigned and incorporated into PCR primers for both insert as well as vector DNA amplification. A specified, unique length of 3 recessed ends is then created in the presence of specific NTP and T4 DNA polymerase and the circular form of DNA, “Sxembled through sequence overlapped ends, is then ready for transformation. An alternative way to produce single-stranded ends employs uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG). This enzyme cleaves all €UMPs which ae incorporated into the PCR primers (11), However, some of these methods, like RCPCR, require ther multiple BCR primer ses, vector amplification, or vector end sequence modifications. Others require a double restriction enzyme cleavage of vector DNA followed bya ligation process for directional cloning (9,10) Recently we developed a simple exonuclease-based strategy to construct PCR products. Ths protocol has the advantages of the Tigasevfree PCR cloning technique but none of the sisadvantages, such as vector amplification, enzymatic ‘manipulation or lack of directional cloning. Here we document its application for constructing bacterial gene fusion mutans for ‘an octamer binding protein (12) To whom corespondtnee should be aed PUBLICATIONS 043641 $039",6

Our data suggest that accessibility of DNA to transcription factors, programmed into the structure of the chromatin, is crucial for initiation of transcription. First, minichromosomes competent to be transcribed in vitro contained nucleosome-free promoter regions. Second, C219 minichromosomes, most of which contain the nucleosome-tree promoter region, supported transcription more efficiently both in vivo and in vitro than wild-type minichromosomes, in which only a subset contain the nucleosome-free region. We have also identified basal transcription factors associated with the in vivo-assembled chromatin templates. A striking correlation was observed between ‘minichromosomes associated with in vivo initiated RNA polymerases and those associated with the basal transcription factors TFIID and TFIIE/F, and to a lesser extent, TFIIB. Of these associated factors, only TFIID was poised for ready assembly into preinitiation complexes and therefore for subsequent initiation of transcription. However, an active chromatin template ‘could also be maintained in the absence of the binding of TFIID. Finally, our data are consistent with the presence of TFIIF in elongating ternary complexes on the chromatin templates. INTRODUCTION Gene expression within eukaryotic eels is regulated inthe context of chromatin, a complex of genomic DNA. histones and noo- histone proteins. One role of chromatin in the regulation of the initiatn of transcription appears 10 be the control of DNA sequence accessibility for binding of transcription factors. Various Tines of evidence suggest that nucleosomes and transcription factors may compete for binding to promoter sequences (1). Induction of transcription in vivo from promoters covered by precisely positioned nucleosomes (2-4) can lead to disruption of particular nucleosomes and apparent unmasking of binding sites for DNA-binding transcription factors (3,59. In addition, assembly of nucleosomes in vtro inhibits transcription from both RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase II promoters (1015), ‘whereas formation of stable preinitiation complexes at the promoters prior to nucleosome assembly generates tran- scriptionally active templates (12,14~ 16). To circumvent inhibition of ‘transcription by chromatin assembly in vivo, transcriptionally active chromatin could form, in several ways. Competition at promoters between the binding Cf transcription factors and the assembly of nucleosomes could ‘occur during DNA replication, when regions of DNA near the replication fork are transiently free of nucleosomes (17) Alternatively. the binding of the specific DNA-binding protein If might exclude nucleosome assembly on the surrounding INA. thus providing promoter accessibility upon induction of gene expression at a later time (18-20), Finally, for genes ‘eanscriptionally activated ina replication-independent manner. inducible transcription factors able to bind to their recognition sites in the promoters in the presence of nucleosomes might trigger the disruption of nucleosomes, allowing the binding of addtional transcription machinery and activation of the promoter. Ultimately, the binding of basal transcription factors to the promoter is essential for initiation of transcription. The roles of the basal transcription factors have been characterized in vitro fon naked DNA templates (21). Detinition of their roles on chromatin templates will also be crucial for understanding, induction of transcription from the chromatin templates in vivo. To examine the roles of chromatin structural alterations and ‘of basal transcription factors in transcription by RNA polymerase Hl on chromatin templates, we have studied initiation of transcription in vitro on in vivo-assembled chromatin.

However, irradiation of the N-methyl group at 2.13 ppm of nicotine in trifluoroacetic acid solution (TFA) did not cause an NOE on the pyridyl protons but rater on the C.2"" and C-8'9 protons. In TFA, the ate of deprotona (of nicotinium diacid salts is slow compared to the NMR time scale, and the peak at 3.13 ppm is attributed tothe ricotinivi salt a whieh the N-methyl group is trans to the pyridine ring. A second singlet at 282 pom isatteibuted to the nicotinium salt in which the V-methyl group is cia ta the pyridine cing, These assignments were established bby NMR studies in mistures of TFA-TF A-d, These resulta are interpreted in term of nizeogen protonationdepro- tonation-pyramidal inversion equilibria and the complexities of NOE studies on configurationally mobile systems. ‘The rates of inversion and proton relaxation are considered. It is estimated that nicotine-eee base exists with its ‘Nemethyl group preferentially (90.9 + 0.9%) trans to the pyridine ring by gas-phase kinetic quenching experiments, ‘The configuration! of nicotine and nicotine acid salts has been a topic of concern for many years."" Nicotine structural analysis indicates two unknown features: the orientation of the N-methyl group and the relative position of the pyridine and pyrrolidine rings. Experimental determination of these two structural parameters is complicated by the likelihood of ow enerzy barriers to change."" We now report the cesults of ‘our studies which show that the preferred (>30%) conti ration of the N-methyl group in nicotine is 1” (R) (ie, trans to the pyridine ring) under a variety of experimental condi- tions. Recently, Chynoweth, Ternai, Simeral, and MacielS con- cluded on the basis of their NMR studies of nicatine in CDCly land Ds0 “that the N-mathyl group is preferentially on the ‘same side of the pyrrolidine ring a8 the pyridine ring”. That conclusion’ contrasted with perturbative configuration in- teraction calculations performed by Pullman, Courriere, and Coubeils,7* which indicated that 1 (see Scheme I) was ap, proximately 4 kcal/mol more stable than 2.1! Other investi gators? based their configurational assignments on (1) steric evaluations using space-filling models or (2) demethylation studies of nicotine N’-oxide. Any conclusion based on these latter two criteria meets with severe criticism. Finally, Koo and Kira® have roported the x-ray analysis ofa crystal of ni= ‘cotine dihydriodide in which the N-methyl group was in a trana configuration with respect to the pyridine ring (ef. 3). However, the crystalline sample was undoubtedly prepared under conditions in which the equilibria shown in Scheme I were operative, and itis theoretically possible that a minor component, or one of a number of components, crystallized. In addition, conclusions based on x-ray data of a solid cannot necessarily be applied to the conformation or configuration, of the same molecule in solution, especially if protonation deprotonation reactions are occurring in solution.'* ~ > 1000769824",6

LAWHARERS BASK IN TOBACCO INSTITUTE'S WARMTH. Rep. Hovard Coble, R-N.C., punched a vinning volley in his stadium court tennis match at the Hyatt Grand Champions resort. Rep. Don Sundquist, R-Tenn., teed off vith a drive straight dovn the fairvay at the adjacent Indian Wells Golf Resort. Rep. Alex McMillan, R-N.C., arrived for dinner in a tan-and-green checked sport coat, a vivid contrast to the stark Dlues and grays he typically Vears for Congress. ‘'Nice jacket,'' commented a member of his party. ‘'I only vear this on junkets to California,'' ne joked. Those members of Congress and about 20 others vere enjoying an all- expense-paid life last veek at the fifth annual legislative conference of the Tobacco Institute. That's the association of cigarette makers and other tobacco interests, vhich after 25 years of surgeon generals’ varnings on the dangers of smoking, insists that smoking cannot be directly linked to cancer, heart disease or stroke. The tobacco industry has good reason to get together vith lavmakers. It faces a range of attacks this year, from proposals to raise cigarette taxes to @ ban on tobacco advertising. Not surprisingly, most members of Congress in attendance either hail from tobacco-producing states or sit on key tax, commerce and other committees that handle bills affecting the industry. So vhile official Washington searched the forecasts for snov last veer, the tobacco folk and lavmakers, many accompanied by their spouses, enjoyed the sun and palm trees at a tvo-year-old Southern California hotel that has 12 tennis courts, 4 svimming pools, 3 restaurants and 2 18-hole golf courses, and vhere the cheapest room costs $200 a night. The Tobacco Institute hired bands for dinner and dancing, as vell In addition to Coble and McMillan, Carolinas lavmakers attending at least part of the four-day conference vere: Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Reps. Tim Valentine, D-N.C., Martin Lancaster, D-N.C., Steve Neal, D-W.C., Charlie Rose, D-N.C., Bill Hefner, D-N.C., and Robin Tallon, D-S.C. Ail but Neal, Hefner and Coble, a bachelor, brought their vives. In addition to travel expenses, most of the lavmakers vill receive a $1,000 honorarium, a kind of appearance fee. They earned it basically by attending a 90-minute seminar to discuss political issues vith some 125 cigarette manufacturers and other Tobacco Institute members. Some heavy hitters, such as Helms and Rep. Dan Rostenkovski chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, gave individual talks. The honoraria are legal. Many lavmakers rely on the fees to increase their income beyond the $89,500 annual salary for senators and representatives. Still, lavmakers acknovledge that the payments offered by special interest groups can pose political problems. The nev Congress may vote on vhether to abolish honoraria as part of a plan to raise lavmakers' salaries to $135,000. D-111., TIMN 0025141",9

Byrne}, Mary Burrous$, and Angelo M. Scanut§ From the Departments of Medicine and §Biochemistry, University of Cheap, Pritzher Schoo of Medicine, ‘Chicago, Minois 60837 Human high-density Lipoprotein class-3 (HDL) was incubated with freshly isolated blood polymorphonu- clear leukocytes (PMN) at 37 and 4 °C. At both tem- peratures the release of proteolytic activity (PA) caus- ing the specific hydrolysis of apo-A-II was dependent on the concentration of HDL; in the medium, At 37°C, the efflux of PA was linear and no saturation was reached up to an HDL, protein concentration in the ‘medium of 800 ug/ml. In turn, at 4°C, maximal PA release was reached at a concentration below 600 ug/ ml of HDL, protein/ml in the medium. Canine HDL, ‘which contains apo-A-I, but not apo-A-IT, was as effe tive as human HDL, in promoting the release of PA from PMN. This property was also exhibited by egg lecithin/eholesterol vesicles containing apo-A-I. At 4°C, there was no strict correlation between efflux of PA affected by HDL; and specific binding of ""*I-apo- A-I(HDL,). In competitive binding experiments, a 50. fold excess of unlabeled HDL, prevented more than 90% of the binding of ""*I-apo-A-I (HDLs) to PMN, ‘whereas an excess of unlabeled low-density lipoprotein exhibited no effect. When human HDL, was incubated ‘with PMN at 4 or 37 °C and then subjected to ultracen- trifugation at d 1.21 g/ml, most of the PA that was, initially associated with this lipoprotein was recovered in the bottom of the tube. By gel filtration, both PA and HDL; were in the same peak ina low ionic strength buffer, but were dissociated from each other by a high- salt solution (4 1.21 g/ml). We conclude that both ns urally occurring HDLs and apo-A-I-stabilized lipid vesicles favor the release from PMN of an enzymatic activity which cleaves human apo-A-II. This release appears to be dependent both on the interaction of the cells with the lipoprotein ligand and on the lipoprotein surface area acting as the acceptor for the enzyme, probably through electrostatic forces.

[n contrast, litle or no changes, were observed in apo-A-I, the major protein constituent of HDL. Subsequently, we found that of the blood leukocytes only PMN cause the proceolysis of apo-A-II in HDLs (2). ‘Since litle is known of the function of apo-A-I, the demon- stration that PMN contain a protease capable of a specific cleavage of apo-A-II prompted us to examine in vitro the mechanisms underlying the release of this cellular protease and the role played by HDL in this process. The results of ‘these studies are the subject of this report. A preliminary ‘account has appeared (3). EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES?

An indirect immunofluorescence technique was used to study the distribution and relative density of nerve fibres containing the general ncuronal marker, protein gene product 9'5; tyrosine hydroxylase; synaptophysin; neuropeptide tyrosine; vasoactive intestinal polypeptide; substance P, somatostatin; and calcitonin gene related peptide. Atall ages in normal and hypertensive lungs neuropeptide tyrosine was the predominant neuropeptide associated with the pulmonary vascular nerves. In normal lungs the relative density of nerve fibres increased during childhood only in the arteries of the respiratory unit. Pulmonary hypertension ‘was associated with the premature innervation of these arteries during the first year of lif. Innervation of small, abnormally thick-walled pre-capillary vessels by predominantly vasocon- strictor nerves may help to explain the susceptibility of infants to pulmonary hypertensive crises. ‘There is no reliable effective medical treatment for pulmonary hypertension. Children with potentially reversible pulmonary vascular disease can die after a ‘technically successful intracardiac repair because of the development of pulmonary hypertensive crises that become intractable to al forms of treatment Pharmacolological management of pulmonary hypertension might be improved by understanding. how the pulmonary vasculature is innervated in such hung. the wall structure of ial tree is remodelled Connective tissue is deposited and medial smooth muscle cells differentiate, acquiring a contractile rather than a synthetic phenotype,"" The concentra- tion of contractile myoflaments increases and the type of cytoskeletal proteins change.” In children with pulmonary hypertensive congenital heart dis- cease these changes are accelerated or abnormal.’ The relation between remodelling of the pulmonary arteries and pulmonary innervation in the human Jung is unclear.

"HPN pray , Y EIQBISFLAHice Memorandum Subject: Proposed Formation of a GC-MS Spectroscopy _ Date: July 15, 1975 Working Group To: Dr. Anders H. Laurene From: Dr. C. R. Green Dr. Alan Rodgman Memorandum: For at least the last five years the Analytical Division has provided mass spectral analysis as a service to the Chemical Division. Since the usage of glass capillary gas chromatography has become more common the chromatographers have found that they must work more and more closely with the mass spectroscopist. In fact, the mass spectrometer has become the detector of choice for glass capillary gas chromatography. These two areas have become so closely allied that the quality of the chromatographic results are often limited by the mass spectral data and conversely the quality of the mass data is often limited by the efficiency of the chromatographic columns. For these reasons I propose the formation of a GC-MS spectroscopy working group consisting of Fred Thome, George Young and myself. The long-range goals of this group would be as follow: 1, Continue research into the preparation of efficient, stable and inert glass capillary columns. 2, Continue research into techniques for the best utilization of glass capillary columns such as ""splitless injection"" and “closed loop"" headspace sampling (not Tenax). 3. Prepare glass capillary columns for all members of the Research Dept. and give advice for their proper and full utilization. 4. Prepare glass capillary colums especially for use with the mass spectrometer. 5. Develop improved techniques for interfacing glass capillary columns to the mass spectrometer. 6. Develop the techniques of combined GC-Specific Ion mass spectroscopy. 7. Develop the techniques of combined GC-Chemical Ionization mass spectroscopy. 9686 96205 IRI FORM 2422-Rev. 7/70",0

Department of Surgical Oncology, University of California San Diego, La Jella, California 92093; land ""Department of Pharmacology, Darmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755 Abstract [A twofold change in the cisplatin (DDP) sensitivity of 2008 hhuman ovarian carcinoma cells is sufficient to reduce tumor response in vivo. The DDP sensitivity of these cells can be enhanced by activation of the epidermal growth factor and pro- ‘ein kinase C signal transduction pathways. We report here that two endogenous growth factors, bombesin and tumor ne- crosis factor alpha (TNFa), enhanced DDP sensitivity by fac- tors of 1.70.1 (SD)-fold and 1.80.1 (SD)-fold, respectively. Both agents also produced sensitization in an 11-fold DDP-re- sistant 2008 subline, Neither bombesin nor TNFa changed the accumulation of DDP, glutathione content, or glutathione-S- transferase activity in 2008 cells. However, a 2-h exposure to ‘oth bombesin and TNFa was suficent to increase 2008 clon- ing efficiency by up to 2.60.1 (SD)-fold and 2.220.1 (SD)- fold, and it increased average colony size by 1.3520.1 (SD)- fold and 1.55+0.1 (SD)-fol, respectively. Bombesin increased intracellular free calcium, and this was blocked by the bombe- sin receptor-specific antagonist SC196, demonstrating that 2008 cells have functional bombesin receptors. These results indicate that bombesin and TNFa can enhance sensitivity to DDP in both DDP sensitive and resistant variants of a human ‘ovarian carcinoma and that both agents serve as growth factors for this tumor.

Furthermore, when TNFa was administered for the treatment of intraperitoneal ovarian cancer xenografts, although it pro longed survival in tumor-bearing mice (10), it also promoted ‘the establishment of multiple subperitoneal tumors. Like 12- (O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), TNFa activates PKCin some cell types and thisin turn may result in increased [AP-| activity and induction of AP-1-responsive genes (14). ‘This is considered to be a key mechanism mediating at least some ofthe biological effects of TNFa mentioned above. ‘We have previously reported that TPA activation of PKC increased DDP sensitivity by a factor of 2.5-fold in human ovarian carcinoma 2008 cells (15). Likewise, epidermal growth factor (EGF), another potent activator of PKC, en hhances DDP sensitivity by 3.1-f0ld in the same cel line (16).

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report COPYRIGHT 1996 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Friday, February 16, 1996 Vol. 45, No. 6, ISSN: 0149-2195 Accessibility of tobacco products to youth aged 12-17 years - United States, 1989 and 1993 Although the sale of tobacco products to minors is illegal in all states and the District of Columbia (1), the prevalence of cigarette smoking among adolescents has continued to increase (2), and most minors are able to purchase tobacco products (3). Reducing sales to minors is believed to be an effective measure for reducing the prevalence of tobacco use (4). To determine recent patterns of minors’ access to tobacco products from retail outlets and vending machines, data were analyzed from the 1989 and 1993 Teenage Attitudes and Practices surveys (TAPS I and TAPS II). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicate that most minors who use tobacco purchase their‘own tobacco and that small stores are the sources of most purchases. Samples for both TAPS I and II were drawn from households that participated in the National Health interview Survey (NHTS), a continuing nationwide household survey that collects information from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged (greater than or equal to] 18 years. Both TAPS I and IT collected information on adolescents’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding tobacco use. TAPS I data were collected by telephone interviews; TAPS II data were collected by telephone and personal interviews and included both a new probability sample and a follow-up of respondents from TAPS 1. Data for persons aged 12-17 years in each survey were analyzed (n=7773 for TAPS I; n=6165 for TAPS Ii) and weighted to provide national estimates. SUDAAN was used to calculate standard errors for determining 95% confidence intervals (cIs) and to perform multivariate logistic regression analyses of TAPS II data; simultaneous adjustments were made for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and region of the country. Differences between TAPS I and TAPS II for selected estimates were assessed by using the Generalized Estimating Equations software (5S). Adjustments were made for subject correlation and age. 9122096902 Adolescents in both TAPS I and II who were current smokers were asked about purchase practices, and all respondents were asked about perceived ease of purchase (6). In TAPS II, adolescents who usually bought, ever bought, or ever tried to buy their own cigarettes were Copr. (C) West 1998 No Claim to Orig: U.S. Govt. Works all",6

A major physiologic mechanism by which mammals respond to tissue hypoxia is through stimulation of erythropoiesis resulting in fan increased blood Oy-carrying capacity.

EPO RNA levels increase several hundredfold in ‘rodent liver and kidney in response to hypoxia or anemia (for review. see refs. 1 and 2). Human EPO RNA levels show ‘similar increases in transgenic mouse liver and kidney (3-6). Hypoxia also induces EPO RNA transcription in Hep3B ‘human hepatoblastoma cells (7), demonstrating thatthe same cell type can sense hypoxia and respond by increasing EPO RNA levels. The production of EPO and subsequent increase in erythropoiesis thus provide a major homeostatic mecha nism for maintaining issue oxygenation. ‘A major research objective in our laboratory has been to identify the cis-acting DNA sequences and trans-acting pro- tein factors that regulate hypoxia-inducible human EPO gene expression.

Treatment of Hep3B cells with cycloheximide inhibited the hypoxic induc- tion of both EPO RNA (7) and HIF-1 DNA binding acuvity (9), These results provided further evidence for the impor- {ance of HIF-1 in EPO gene transcriptional activation by hypoxia and suggested that induction of HIF-1 activity ‘quires de novo protein synthesis. ‘A growing number of other mammalian genes have been Feported whose expression is induced by hypoxia (11-15). ‘The molecular basis for induction has not been established for any of these genes, although induction of vascular endo- thelial growth factor RNA is inhibited by cycloheximide (14). To determine whether HIF-1 plays a general role in the hypoxic activation of gene transcription, we have analyzed ‘mammalian cell ines in which the EPO gene is nat expressed. HIF-1 was induced by hypoxia in all cell lines tested, including human 293 embryonic kidney and HeLa cervieal carcinoma cells, mouse Ltk~ fibroblasts, and C:Cy skeletal ‘myoblasts, Ratl fibroblasts, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The physiological relevance of HIF-1 induction was supported by our demonstration that the hypoxia- inducible enhancer was functional in CHO and 293 eels, whereas the 3-nt mutation that eliminated HIF-1 binding rendered the enhancer noninducible. These results implicate HIF-Lin the transcriptional regulation of gene expression by hypoxia in a variety of mammalian cell types.

"‘The first 79 residues of the yeast Bte2p G protein- coupled pheromone receptor, Including the negatively charged N-terminal domain, the firet transmembrane segment, and the following positively charged eytoplas- imc loop, has been fused to a Kex2p-cleavable Prlacta- ‘ase reporter. Insertion orientation was determined by ‘analysis of cell-associated and secreted flactamase ac- tivities and independently corroborated by analysis of membrane association and glycosylation patterns. This fusion inserts with exclusively N terminus exofacial (5) topology, serving as a model type II! membrane protein. Orientation is unaffected by removal of all three positively charged residues in the cytoplasmic loop or by deletion of all but 12 residues from the N- terminal domain. The residual —2 Neerminal charge apperently provides a signal sufficient to determine Nass topology. This is entirely consistent with the tatle tically derived rule in which the charge difference, A(C-N), counted for the 15 immediately flanking real: ues, is the primary topology determinant. Mutations altering A(C-N) to zero favors Noxy insertion by 8 to 1, whereas increasingly negative values cause increasing inversion of orientation. All results are consistent with the charge difference rule and indicate that whereas pos- itive charges promote eytoplaamle retention, negative charges promote translocation.

Qn March 22, justice Sunni Stromberg Stein of British Columbia, Supreme Court struck down the Workers Compensation Board’ (WCB) province-wide smoking ban in restaurants and bars, ruling that the hospitality industry had little opportunity to fight it. The Judge agreed with the Hotel and Pub Owners Association that too few public hearings were held (WA00-12). High Court Denies FDA Tobacco Regulation: Siking what ABC Nevs teed a major bow to the ign,” led 5-4 on March 21* the Fc in Brug Administration (FDA) does tt have the authonty to regulate tobacco, Justices Sanda Day ‘O'Connor (who wrote the majority opinion), Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Chief justice William H. Rehnquist decided that Congress never gave such authority to the FDA. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. stated, “Business and industry throughout the nation ought to breathe a sigh of relief. The highest court in the land has confirmed that a Federal agency cannot on its own go beyond its limits of authority set by Congress.” The decision entails that the FDA’s compliance checking program for those who look 27 or younger is no longer in effect though the States may assume such controls. Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Bonnie Herzog believes that Congress will eventually legislate such regulation (though not during the 2000 election year) though some Congressmen were quick to act. On March 22, Representative Henry Waxman (D-CA) introduced two bills, The Child Tobacco Use Prevention Act of 2000 and The FDA Tobacco Jurisdiction Act of 2000 that would give the FDA the regulatory authority it seeks. The first bill includes a number of tobacco control and youth smoking measures as well.

USS. Litigation: The jurors in San Francisco, California‘s Whiteley trial awarded Leslie Whiteley and her husband compensatory damages of $1.7 million and were deciding a punitive damage award as of this writing. According to Sanford Bernstein analyst Bill Pecoriello, the punitive damage award is likely to ‘come in at between $10-20 million per company, though there are no limits under California law. Early assessments; Defendants had stressed various mitigating factors such as Ms. Whiteley’s former drug use and the fact that she began smoking well after warning labels were present on cigarette packs. “The message of this case is that the warning defense is not the ironclad defense it was before,” said product liability expert Greg Keating from the University of Southern California. “This isa landmark case,” 699 798ZS RJR0000001283018391 70042 5353",2

INTRODUCTION Within recent years, speech science has focused on changes in patients” speech that accompany laryngeal pathology. For instance, measures of cycle-to-cycle variations in fundamental frequency (jitter) and variations. in cycle-to-cycle amplitude (shimmer) have been useful in describing the voice characteristics of both normal and pathological speakers (Koike, 1973; Hollien, Michel, and Doherty, 1973; Koike, 1969; Murry and Doh- erty, 1977; Smith, Weinberg, Feth, and Horii, 1978; Horii, 1979, 1980) This irregularity in vibration has been implicated as a physical correlate ‘of rough or hoarse voices (Moore and Thompson, 1965; Michel, 1966: Coleman and Wendahl, 1967). In addition, jitter and shimmer measures have been applied to the early detection of laryngeal pathology (Lieber- man, 1963; Crystal, Montgomery, Jackson, and Johnson, 1970). The acoustic analysis used in these studies presumes that voice characteris tics, examined in terms of the laryngeal vibratory rate, are peculiarly powerful and sensitive parameters for measuring the functional and an- atomic status of the laryngeal mechanism, Hecker and Kreul (1971) identified an effective parameter for separating ‘Address correspondence to: David Sorensen, Department of Communication, Kaufinan Mall, University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma 73070 1 1964 by Lever Scene Publishing Co te 143 52 Vander Ave» Nes York, NY 100 ont. gen40}.00 50554833",6

In cells expressing only #1, homodimers and -tcimers of HI are formed. In contrast, when expressed in 373 cells without Ht, H2 is synthesized as its 43-kDa precursor, bearing high-mannose ‘oligosaccharides, but israpldly degraded, When HI and H2.are ‘coexpressed inthe same cell the Ht polypeptide “rescues” the 2 polypeptide; H2 is processed to its characteristic S0-kDa ‘mature form and is transported to the surface. We conclude that the human ASGP-R is a moltichain beterooligomer, probably a trimer of HI molecules in noncovalent association with one, two, or three H2 molecules, and that the two polypeptides normally interact early in biosynthesis. ‘The hepatocyte asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) binds with high-affinity serum glycoproteins bearing multiple ter- minal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues. It has served as a model for many of the events of receplor- mediated endocytosis, such as ligand binding, receptor— ligand dissociation and sorting, and recycling ofthe receptor to the cell surface (1-3). The human ASGP-R, purified from liver or the hepatoma cell line HepG2, was thought to be composed only of a single 46-kDa polypeptide, designated HL. However, by cDNA cloning (4, 5) and direct identfica- tion (6), second and less abundant human ASGP-R molec- ‘lar species, H2 (49-50 kDa), has been characterized. Are these two human ASGP-R polypeptides independent recep- tors with different functions and specificities, or do they only together comprise a functional ASGI McPhaul and Berg (7) demonstrated that Expression of both rat ASGP-R cDNAs, rat hepatic lectin (RHL)-1 and RHL-2/-3, is required to form a functional ASGP-R in rat HTC cells, one that can internalize and accumulate in lysosomes fluorescent-labeled asialoorosomucoid (ASOR). ‘Sawyer et al. (8) showed that plasma membrane RHL-1 and RHL-2/-3 peptides do interact noncovalently. In contrast, on the basis of chemical crosslinking and galactose affinity ‘chromatography studies, Drickamer and his colleagues ‘cluded that the at ASGP-R polypeptides associate only into distinct homooligomers of RHL-1 or RHL-2/-3 (9). In par ticular, they could not chemically cross-link RL-1 with “The polation costs ofthis article were defrayed in part by page charge ‘payment, Thivarile must therefor be hereby masked"" aoveriemen?” accordance with 18 U.S.C. 41734 Solely to indicate this fact. uss RHL-2/3, but they were able o crosslink each respective peptide to isel to form homooligomers ©). ‘Using chemical cross-linking and antibody-induced degra- ation protocols, we showed that, in HepG2 els, Hl and H2 form a heterooligomer (10). Here we examine the fate ofthe individual polypeptides in singly transfected mouse NIH 3T3 cells or in 313 cells that express both human ASGP-R polypeptides. We propose a model ofthe ASGP-R structure in which a “core” trimer of HI molecules can interact with ‘one, two, of three H2 molecules. Although the exact stoi chiometry of the interactions between H1 and H2 is stl tunknown, itis clear that these polypeptides must interact carly in biosynthesis to assemble a functional ASGP-R. MATERIALS AND METHODS Construction of pDOL-ASGP-R. All DNA manipulations involved standard techniques (1). The retroviral expression vector pDO-L was kindly provided by A. Korman, C. Cepko, and RC. Mulgan of he Whitehead Institute (12). The entre coding regions of Hl and H2 were excised from the plasmids pSAL-and pSA2 (4, §) and ligated into the Bamdil site of PDO-L via Bg!

As a first step, T would be happy to set up a meeting with you and some of your people with Research and Development so that we may have an open discussion (educational session) on the various aspects of gases. Also, Lark II has opened test market in Florida with heavy advertising emphasis on gas consideration. I think it would be helpful if you would consider what information could be gathered from the consumer in this apparent test area.

I like it because it sets up separate snoking and non smoking sections. A nice, simple idea. And if it had stopped there, it would get my vote. But it dnesn't stop there. It goes on to provide for government regulators to come along and run our lives and our businesses. And, it's full of things like fines and the possibility of citizens arrest and heavy-handed expensive bureaucracy and -- oh my, dozens of things that make no sense-at’all. And the problem is: we can't vote for just the nice, simple idea. If Proposition 10 becones law, all of it becomes law. And I'd much prefer to leave most of it to people's good common sense.

Dahl, Lead Tex Analyst for RJ Reynolds. A copy of this letter is attached for your reference. 1 appreciate that RJ Reynolds notified our Department of Revenue of its intent to “ship gratis cigarettes for sampling purposes” to certain events in Colorado. As the events described are likely to have significant youth audience attendance, 1 am requesting assurance from you that the sampling will comply with all relevant provisions of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. As you are aware, MSA § III(a) provides that a Participating Manufacturer may NOT take any action, directly or indirectly, to target Youth in the advertising, promotion or marketing of Tobacco Products, In addition, MSA § I11(4) prohibits Outdoor Advertising in the form of any billboards or any signs or placards in arenas or stadiums. And most importantly, MSA § II(g) prohibits the distribution of any free samples of Tobacco Products except in Adult-Only Facilities. ‘Thank you in advance for acknowledging our concems and confirming that R.J. Reynolds will take every step necessary to assure compliance with the MSA. In your response, I would ask that you outline what specific steps you plan to take to comply with the MSA, particularly { how you plan to have adult-only facilities at these events. In addition, please note that the event listed for July 19-21 in Morrison is identified as “Winston Drag Race.” As per previous correspondence, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has discontinued its sponsorship of “NHRA Winston Drag Racing.” Therefore, the referenced event appears to be prohibited pursuant to MSA § III(c). I trust this was an oversight and would request you delete any reference to “Winston Drag Race” in the future, § e & & $",0

"(COMPARISON BETWEEN THE METHOD OF CHOU AND TALALAY AND A NEW METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT (OF THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF DRUGS: A MONTE-CARLO SIMULATION STUDY Kenneth Cyrus and Wi ‘A Bethod has been developed and tested for determining whether the combi- nation of two agente is synergistic, ad- ditive or antagonistic. The method con sists of fitting a set of equations in = hierarchical manner to dose-response data with nonlinear regression, choosing the model which best fits the data, and in- terpreting the resulting parameter eati- mates. Our method ie compared with that of Chou and Talalay (Adv. Enz. Regul 22: 27-85, 1984) by conducting Monte- Carlo simulations with both methods. ‘The Monte-Carlo simulations showed a clear superiorty of our method over that of Chou and Talalay for making decisions regarding the nature of the interaction between two drugs. The anjor problens of the latter wethod stem from: (1). the forced fitting of a straight line to a nonlinear function; (2) an incorrect extrapolation step from the above fitt ‘and (3) an incorrect equation for calculating @ combination index (CI). Our method performed well under many con- ditions, and can be easily extended to nore complex situations. Introduction ‘The assessment of the combined ef- fects of drugs is a field with a long, rich history and a profound importance for the present and future, The introd- uctory sections of three recent articles trace the development of the field (Kedel1 and Pounds, 1983; Chow and Talelay, 1984; Berenbaum, 1985). For the sake of brevity the history will not be included in thie paper. ‘The effect models presented in this paper are only applicable to situations Where effect is a continuous, monotonic function of the drug dose. Thus, situ- ations where the effect variable is quan- tal, or not monotonic, or where data can be Censored are not covered here.” Note that the Nonlinear regression method will hereafter be denoted as NLR, while the yethod of Chou and Talalay will be denoted as CAT.

Bob Stone requests mail and phone calls to the retailers to urge their attendance at this meeting. Mesa, Ariz, - The city council voted on 12/20 to amend the city’s smoking ban. The ordinance allows smoking in bars and restaurant bar areas. Restaurants can get a hardship variance if they can prove a.15 percent loss over a four month period. Businesses can also have a separate outdoor smoking arca and hotels can allow smoking in private, rented ‘conference rooms. Opponents of the smoking ban filed sufficient signature to force either modification of the ban or a special election on the issue. Although 5 of the 7 council ‘members said they supported a special election, the council decided to amend rather than call for an election. The city clerk said that an election was still possible, but not likely. The amended language will go into effect 30 days from passage. RJR0000000507062775 70017 7526 gezy 1087S",2

First* ‘Harvard School of Pubic Heath, 665 Huntington Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02115 Gary L. Huber ervard Medica! School, 25 Shattuck Street, Bosion, Massachusetts 02115 prior reports have indicated that snslysis of nicotine at plco- am por milter levels was unreliable. Significant and ‘arlable nicotine adsorption on the diferent materials used ‘uring analysis was recognized as a source of error, and suppression of nicotine adsorption phenomena during sample preparation by addition of NH,OH was found to be a crfical {actor In obtaining rellable resuits at this concentration. We have adapted ths method, using # trogen sensitive detector ‘and gas chromatographic techniques, to determine nicotine reproducibly In at, water, and blood plasma, The lowest detectable amount Is 2-5 pg of nicotine Injected into the ‘column, and the calibration curve is linear up to 2000 ng/mL. ‘The relative standard error of estimate of peak area depen- dence on concentration is 8%, In the past 2 decades several gas chromatographic tech- sigues forthe determination of nicotine have been described U-9). The determination of nicotine in biological fluids (plasma urine, milk) has been of particular interest to in- estigators studying the biologic effects of tobacco smoking. In almost all cases, prior to the introduction of gas chroma- ‘ographic (GC) techniques, nicotine had to be extracted from ological fluids by relatively complex procedure which were ‘less than fully quantitative. Futhermore, the final extract ‘represented a complex mixture of organic compounds that ‘ave many peaks in the gas chromatogram which were difficult {o interpret ‘This complexity was reduced substantially bythe intro duction of a nitrogen-sensitive detector into the GC procedure. As the nitrogen-sensitive detector does not respond to organic compounds containing only C, H, and O atoms, it yields a relatively simple GC spectrum. Compared to flame ionization ‘detectors (FID), the higher sensitivity of the nitrogen-sensitive ‘detector has made it easier to analyze solutions where nicotine ‘apresent in minute concentrations (for example, in te blood ‘of human smokers). On the other hand, the increased sen- sitivity introduced by these techniques makes it more difficult ‘to achieve an acceptable level of reproducibility of the ex- ‘taction and determination procedures, partiularly for sam- les that contain a low concentration of nicotine. For this teason, many investigators adopted the use of internal ‘Standards and evaluated their samples relative to this internal standard, expressing their resulta as “nicotine ratios"". To ‘improve analytical results, Feyerabend (4) suggested the use ‘of quinoline as an internal standard, but Hengen and Hengen (7) were unable to obtain good results using his method. In our experience, even simple nicotine solutions in water organic solvents at concentration level of tens of nanograms Der milliliter were difficult to analyze reliably by gas chro- ‘atography using Feyerabend's method. Disturbing phe- ‘Romena, such as ghost peaks of nicotine, were observed. In ¢ Pp e > e tion, unexpected losses of nicotine occurfed. Similar difficulties seem to have been encountered by olher authors. For example, Dow and Hall (6) presented a calibration curve for nicotine in terms ofa “nicotine internal standard response ratio"" that showed a distinct value ofthis ratio even for 270 concentrations of nicotine. They therefore developed a com- bined technique employing gas chromatography-mass spec- trometry (GC-MS) (9) forthe determination of nicotine. ‘The objective of our present study was to investigate the sourees of interferences observed in previously described gas chromatographic methods and to develop a gas chromoto- graphic method for reliably measuring concentrations of Dicotine less than 1 ng/mL in gases and liquids.

"September 9, 1982 To: Mr. E. J. Fackelman FROM: K. V. McCaffrey RE: Project AA With regards to your memo of September 2, let me say that while I don't disagree with the premise that imagery concepts are the most difficult to develop and refine on the down side, I do feel that the upside of Project AA has been completely overlooked. 1. To put it in your words, I view Project AA as being ""corrective"" imagery and not ""compatible"" imagery. If the designer name was Calvin Klein then I would say that AA is in a ""compatible"" image mode. However, Yves Saint Laurant is a high fashion Paris designer who is viewed as having distinctive sophisticated products which young adult female smokers want to be able to afford in their later years but cannot attain at this time. ‘The strength that I see in Project AA is a distinctive product coupled with a reinforcing image that could generate a very positive appeal. This premise is based on women's return to femininity. But I don't mean femininity in the traditional sense. Today's femininity includes not only physical attractiveness but also includes intelligence, independence, self-confidence and the ability to successfully lead a full, rich life. The sexual . revolution is not part of today's 18-24 year old woman. They assume that all avenues of opportunity are open to them but they want to project themselves as attractive women not neuter gender. 2. Project AA's main benefit to its target group is a cigarette that has a distinctively subtle taste (not overpowering) that is better than other brands on the market today. The reason or support for why this cigarette is better is due to the designer name influence. This influence causes expectations of a distinctive product that must be provided or consumers will feel they have been mislead. (As information, a formal positioning statement will be issued the week of September 13.) However, the bottom line is a subtly distinctive product with a subtly distinctive image carrier. 3. While it was known from the beginning that the odds of finding a solution to the 18-24 year old Corporate gap were minimal, Executive Management felt that at least we might gain some usable consumer information. Therefore, a rather rapid schedule was devised to not waste efforts if a solution did not appear quickly. znee LnZ0S",0

"WE Beicrige zur Tabakforschung + Band 9 - Heft 3 - Oktober 1977 Cigarette Smoke Formation Studies V. The Effects of the Cigarette Periphery on Mainstream Smoke Formation” by Robert W, Jenkins, Jr» Roger T. Bass, Richard H. Newman and Mavie K. Chavis Philip Morris Researds Center, Richmond, Virginia, U.S.A. INTRODUCTION In a recent report, recommendations for the seandard- ied preparation of carbon-14 labelled cigarettes were made (1). Ie was shown that the error generated in uniformly placing the radiosctive label axially with the rod is also the degree of error reflected in the radio- activity recovered from total smoke. Cigarees with large variations in the axial placement of the label would equite che smoking of a large mumber of such cigarertes, to determine the toral smoke distribution. The data thus generated are reflective of the average values, but with a large experimental error. The more usiformly labelled ‘he cigareree the smaller the error in the total smoke distribution. When the_radioactivity ie not uniformly distributed radially within the cigacene, the smoking of a large ‘umber of ‘cigarettes might not overcome any bias imparted to the data. Egerton (2), Keith (3), Wakeham (A) and Osdene (5) have all theorized about the effects of the periphery on mainseream smoke formation. To date, thee is very litle experimental evidence to si Pore these hypotheses. In order to empitically ascerain the importance of the tobacco periphery to smoke for- ‘ation, carbon-{4 labelled cigareres have been prepared ‘ith uniform and non-uniform radial labelling. Effecs ‘of radial positioning on the total smoke distributions ‘were measured, MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of Labelled Cigarettes ‘The cabon-i4 labelled cigarertes were fabricated by the procedures recommended for the standardized pee- aration of labelled cigareres (1). The cigaretes were Prepared by three basi incorporation methods: 1. Syringe-Spiking: This procedure was used to add the labelled compounds primarily to the central portion ‘of the cigarere sod (1). 2. Spraying: This procedure was employed: when solu lity permiteed, and produced cigarette filler uniformly labelled with the carboo-14 compounds, Cigarettes were then handmade at previously deveribed (1) ese or oan Sey tm, 126 3, Sheetcasting-Blending: This procedure was used when materials were insoluble in desired solvents. The labelled sheet materials were then either uniformly blended into ‘normal University of Kenmucky 1R1 reference fller or ‘were added at discrete radial postions within the ciga- seus od (1). Radiodbemicale Dottiacontane-16,17-4C was purchased from Male lindkrodt Nuclear and proline-4C (U) from New Eng land Nuclear. Nicotine-HC (U) and cellalose-""C () ‘were obtained from bioeynthesized Brighe tobaccoMC (©) (6) Invere sugar (U) war prepared by the weat- iment of glucose-HC (U) (New England Neclear) with invertase. Radiochemical purities in all cases were beer than 98% before application. Radioactivity Determinations ‘Appropriate liquots of the extracted or combusted samples were counted in a Packard Model 3390 scintle lation spectrometer (Packard Instrument Company) with ‘optimized gain and window settings.

"Tobacco Industry Savz Tt Wants to Liwit Children Smobangs BY FOUL Fil ER AP Science Writer WASHINGTON (AP) - The tobacce industry, which manufactures billions of cigarettes a year, said Tuesday it wants to keep children from lighting up. ‘SwWe want to protect children from making decisions that they are not capable of,’' Tobacco Institute vice president Brennan M. Dawson said at 4 news Jonference announcing a campaign to keep cigarettes away from anyone under 18+ “oT a child never picks up anether cigarette it would be fine with the tebacco industry, ’’ Dawson said. But anti-smoking groups immediately attacked the industry announcement 3 hypocritical. ‘The ... campaign is little more than a clever smoke screen designed more for publicity than to effectively discourage tobacco us@ among our nation s young people,’‘ said Fran Du Melle of the American Lung Association. Dawson said the campaign would support state laws limiting cigarette sales to adults and would put new limitations on billboard and other tobacco advertising and dstribute a parent’s guide on how to discourage children from smoking. However, she said the guidelines won’t prevent cigarette companies ftom cantinuing ta sponsor sporting events, such as tennis tournaments. Dawson said she didn’t know the cost of the program, but said it was **millions of dollars.'’ Du Melle, whe represented a coalition that includes the American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society, called the Tobacco Institute program °° just another public relations effort to head off congressional congideration of meaningful and effective legislation to regulate what has proven itself to be an irresponsible industry.“ Ghe said the industry action would not curtail marketing tactics targeted at children. Once again, the tobacco industry seeks to mislead the oublic about i intentions by putting forward a package of reforms which don’t go Tar enough te have a meaningful impact,’’ Du Melle said. °*These proposals can’t withstand the most minimal scrutiny.‘ ’ Another anti-smoking group, Action on Smoking Or Health, said there already are local government efforts under way ‘to curtain sales of cigarettes to minors and that the tobacco industry campaign **is simply making a virtue of necessity. “° ‘32 don’t think anything the tobacco industry does will ever satisty our critics,’’ Dawson said when asked if the industry was trying to avoid federal Legislation.

Included are findings from the February Field Sales Price Survey, product analysis done by R&D, and in-market observations from a field trip to Evansville, Indiana, and Atlanta, Georgia, the veek of March 6. Background Liggett introduced Pyramid nationally about mid-January in five styles: Non-Filter Kings, Filter Lights Kings, Filter Lights 100’s, Filter Lights Menthol 100’s, and Ultra Lights 100’s. The product vas initially scheduled for introduction on Decenber 15, but delays in shipments vere reported throughout the country. Wholesalers vere given $12 per 12M introductory case allovance and 30 day terms. They vill also be paid 8¢ per carton rebate allovance. All product is guaranteed by Liggett. (Attach- ment I) According to Liggett, ""Pyramid offers brand name assurance of quality as vell as lov- est price in the market, and future price and excise tax increases vill only magnify its appeal Liggett’s strategy is to target high volume direct accounts such as price clubs, state line outlets, Indian stores, large independents, and chains that cooperate. Salesmen are instructed to especially concentrate on the highly developed generic aceas on a market by market basis. Liggett prices the product at $19.25/H for Kings and $20.50/M for 100's - $12.50/H ($2.50 per carton) less than DORAL. I. In-Market Pricing Pricing information on Pyramid vas obtained via the February 22 national Field Sales Price Survey. While the brand had achieved only limited retail distribu- tion at the time of the survey, sample sizes vere sufficient to provide insights as to the trade’s handling of Pyramid prices. The following are highlights of the survey results: e © Pyramid vas in distribution in about 8% of the retail outlets surveyed on February 22. The brand, however, was available in about half (46.9%) of the vholesale accounts, vhich vas in line vith Liggett’s plan to first present Pyramid to vholesale and high volume retail accounts. 8TL> sects",0

"Bacty's Igdvstrial Hygiene and Toxicology Vol:3A ch:07-202 The Fundamentais be 2.2 The Fundamentals behind the TLVs The ACGIH TLVs and most other OELs are limits that refer to airborne concentrations of substances and represent conditions under which ""it is believed that nearly all workers may be repeatedly exposed day-after-day without adverse health effects"" ((4) ACGIH, 1992). It is important to recognize that unlike some exposure limits for ambient air pollutants, contaminated water, or food additives set by other professional groups or regulatory agencies, exposure to the TLV will not necessarily prevent discomfort or injury for everyone who is exposed ((7) Adkins et al., 1990). The ACGIH recognized long ago that because of the wide range in individual susceptibility, a small percentage of workers may experience discomfort from some substances at concentrations at or below the threshold limit and that a smaller percentage may be affected more seriously by aggravation of a preexisting condition or by development of an occupational illness (47) Cooper, 1973; (140) Omenn, 1982; (4) ACGIH, 1992). This is clearly stated in the introduction to the ACGIH's annual booklet “Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical Agents and Biological Exposure Indices"" ((4) ACGIH, 1992). : This limitation, although perhaps less than ideal, has been considered a practical one since airborne concentrations so low as to protect hypersusceptibles have traditionally been judged infeasible due to either engineering or economic limitations. This shortcoming in the TLVs has, until the past 4 years, not been considered a serious one. If society wishes to significantly reduce workplace exposures, by using engineering controls and personal protective equipment, it is now possible to do so. In light of the dramatic improvements of the past 10 years in our analytical capabilities, personal monitoring/sampling devices, biological monitoring techniques, and the use of robots as a plausible engineering control, we are now technologically able to consider more stringent occupational exposure limits. Whether we are willing to invest the financial resources needed to control workplace exposure to much lower levels or whether it makes good economic sense to do so is not yet known ((222) U.S. EPA SAB, 1990). Threshold limit values, like most other OELs used in other countries, are based on the best available information from industrial experience, experimental human and animal studies, and, when possible, from a combination of the three ((196) Smith and Olishifski, 1988; (4) ACGIH, 1992). The rationale for each of the values differs from substance to substance. For example, protection against impairment of health may be a guiding factor for some, whereas reasonable freedom from irritation, narcosis, nuisance, or other forms of stress may form the basis for others. The age and completeness of the information available for establishing most occupational exposure limits also varies from substance to substance; consequently, the precision of each particular TLV is subject to variation. The most recent TLV and its documentation should always be consulted in order to evaluate the quality of the data upon which that value was set. The background information and rationale for each TLV is published periodically in the Documentation of the Threshold Limit Values (ACGIH, 1989). Some type of documentation is ‘occasionally available for OELs set in other countries. The rationale or documentation for a particular OEL should always be consulted before interpreting or adjusting an exposure limit, as well as the specific data considered in establishing it ((4) ACGIH, 1992). Even though all of the publications that contain OELs emphasize that they were intended for use only in establishing safe levels of exposure for persons in the workplace, they have been used at times in other situations. itis for this reason that all exposure limits should be interpreted and applied only by someone knowledgeable of industrial hygiene and toxicology. The TLV committee did not intend that they be used, or modified for use: 2073095202 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1998. ALL rights reserved. = a",6

These rate constants were es- timated by optimizing the model fit to pharmacokinetic data ‘obtained by administering an intraarterial ($)-[5-H] nicotine bolus of 0.1 mg/kg to 6 rats. Model simulations that optimized for the appearance of cotinine in plasma estimated Kyc and Kp to be 75.8 and 24.3 hr“*, respectively. Use of these con- stants in the model allowed us to accurately predict nicotine plasma kinetics and the fraction of the dose eliminated by rena) (8.5%) and ruetabolic (91.5%) clearance. To validate the model's ability 10 predict tissue kinetics of nicotine, 21 male SD rats were administered 0.1 mg/ke (S)-I5- HiJnicotine intraarterially. At seven time points following treatment, 3 rats were euthanized and tissues were removed and analyzed for nicotine. Model-predicted nicotine tissue kinetics were in agreement with those determined experi- mentally in muscle, liver, skin, fat, and kidney, The brain, heact, and lung exhibited nonlinear nicotine elimination, sag ‘esting that saturable nicotinic binding sites may be important in nicotine disposition in these organs. Inclusion of saturable receptor binding expressions in the mathematical description of these compartments resulted in better agreement with the experimental data, The Baa, and Ko estimated by model sim- ulations for these tissues were brain, 0.009 and 0.125 lung, 0.039 and 2.0; and heart, 0.039 nmol/tissue and 0.12 ns, respectively.

Tobacco use represents the most substantial exposure 10 nicotine. Surveys by the Centers for Disease ‘Control indicate that 26.5% ofthe adult US population are smokers (CDC, 1987). This extensive use of tobacco in our society has generated concern over the potential health risks associated with nicotine (DHHS, 1989). Accurately pre- dicting nicotine uptake and disposition in humans isa nec- essary step in assessing the potential adverse health effects of nicotine. Although plasma pharmacokinetics have been extensively documented in animals(Kyerematen eta. 1982, 1987, 1988: Adir tal, 1976; Rotenberg et al. 1980) and ‘humans (Rosenberg ea, 1980; Scherer eral, 1988; Kyee ematen «al, 1990), the relationship between plasmia con- centrations, tissue concentrations, and pharmacologic or toxicologc effects are not well understood, The principal pharmacologic actions of nicotine are me- ated through central and peripheral nicotinic receptors (Su, 1982; Lippielo and Fernandes, 1986). These effets bave been reported tobe dose dependent znd include modulation of cardiac functions (Rosenberg etal, 1980), brain electro physiology (Clarke, 1990), and systemic vascular blood flow (Benowitz e a, 1990: Henrich eral, 1984). In addition, recent evidence that chronic nicotine administation results {nan increas in the density of nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the mammalian brain has resulted in. the experimental administration of nicotine to Alzheimer’s patients (New- house etal, 1988; Sahakian ef al, 1989).

"INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM SUBJECT: Lung Weight Data DATE: February 11, 1987 To: Dr. G. T. Burger FROM: C. R. E. Coggins Attached to this note are the data from Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory (BPNWL) on lung weights, giving absolute data and the ratios of Tung weight to brain weight and to body weight. Note that there are only 15 observations for each mean (c.f. up to 30 for the in-house study). The data could be interpreted as showing an increase in the mean Tung weight of the RHD group, and some of the (unpublished) work that I am aware of would agree with such an interpretation. I consider that we should use the ""spare"" lungs originally destined for the measurement of biochemical endpoints to determine whether or not the increased weights are due to increased fluid content, or whether the lungs are indeed heavier. The measurement of a dry weight, either by ashing or by a microwave technique, is of course a destructive procedure. However, I do not think that the lungs can be usefully employed in any other way, because they were not inflated before being frozen. I recommend asking Arnold Mosberg to determine whether or not BPNWL could determine wet and dry weights on the lungs, and to obtain a cost estimate for the work.

Smoking history is missing for 235 of the study subjects and degree of “missingness” depends on disease status. age, and birth-year. To account for the nonrandomness of the missing data. Markov chain Monte Carlo method for covariate imputation is proposed and implemented. Results from this analysis also support a nonsignificant gene ‘smoking interaction and an allele frequency of 2%, but a lower genetic rela- live risk (9.0) compared to the “complete ease” analysis.

"woe Carcinogenesis Assay of Subfractions of Cigarette Smoke Condensate Prepared by Solvent-Solvent Separation of the Neutral Fraction ** Fred G. Bock, A. P. Swain? and R. L. Stedman,' Roswell Park Memorial Institute, New York State Department of Health, Buffalo, New York 14203; and Eastern Marketing ‘and Nutrition Research Division, Agricultural Reseorch Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Philadelphio, Pennsylvonia 19118 SUMMARY—Carcinosenesis assay was conducted on subfractions of the neuteal fraction (NF) of cigarette smoke condensate, subfractions that were prepared by solvent partition. Of the 2 mojor subficctions, the “methanol- ingoluble” neutrals (MIN) were much more active than’ the “methanol- soluble” neutrals (MSN). Distibution of MSN between nitromethane ond carbon disulfide yielded 2 ective fractions. Poot dose-response effects suggest that extraneous materials may teduce the activity of MSN. Analysis of the recovery of MSN is difficult, but opoarently there were significant losses ducing separation. On countticurent distribution (CCD), MIN yielded 3 octive and 2 inactive subfractions. Recovery of the activity of MIN jn the subfractions was excellent in comparison with an eatlier separa- ie acid chromatostophy. Recoveries might be improved if 18 AN earlier study, 4 of the subfractions prepared silicic acid chromatography of the neutral frac- te (CSC) induced skin tumors in. mice. previously painted with 125 ug of 7,12-dimethylbenafalanthracene (DMBA) (1). With this procedure, tumor-promot~ ing agents as well as complete carcinogens were detected. All the subfractions were recombined in proportion to their yield, to provide a reconstituted sample that would have been identical with NF if no changes had occurred during the separation procedure. The biological activity of this recon- stituted material, however, was substantially less than that of NF, suggesting that important amounts of the active materials were lost during chroma- tography. The current study was undertaken to examine solvent partitioning alone as means of fractionating NF, with the, hope that these loses could be avoided. MATERIALS AND METHODS Details of the preparation of the various fractions will be described elsewhere (2).

""Acute Lower Respiratory Illness in Childhood as a Predictor of Lung Function and Chronic Respiratory Symptoms"" American Review of Respiratory Disease 140: 877-884, 1989. SUMMARY: This study investigated the relationship of acute lover respiratory illness (LRI) to level and change in level of forced expiratory volumes in a cohort of 801 children, followed Yongitudinally for a maximum of 13 yr. The co-occurrence of respiratory illness before 2 yr of age and two or more LRI during a single surveillance year was associated with a 20.3% lower mean Gross“sectional level of FEF25~75, and with reduced longitudinal Change in level of FEF25~75, The effect of LRI on lung function was Uniformly stronger for boys than for girls. Of the children with illness before 2 yr of age and two or more LRI, six of 14 Were male asthnatics with mean levels of FEF25-75 that were lower than those of other asthmatic children. Pneumonia and/or hospitalization for respiratory illnes prior to the onset of study were associated with lower cross-sectional levels of forced expiratory volumes at entry to the study, even when asthnatics/persistent wheezers were eliminated from the analysis (6.1% lower level of FEV1 for a nonasthmatic boy with previous hospitalization versus a nonasthnatic boy without hospitalization). In the longitudinal analysis, pneumonia and/or hospitalization were associated with slower increase in level of forced expiratory volunes, even after adjusting for ""ever diagnosis of asthna/current any wheeze"" (starting at the same level, after eight years a boy with hospitalization would develop a 5.0% lower FEV1 than a boy without hospitalization). Acute LRI also was evaluated as a predictor of chronic respiratory symptoms. A strong association was found between previous hopitalization and subsequent chronic cough (Odds Ratio [OR]= 3.8)/chronic phlegm (OR= 7.1) at entry to the study: eight years later, smoking was the only significant predictor of these symptons, and no hospitalized child had taken hp smoking. Future studies may enable us to explore interactions between severe respiratory illness in early childhood and the effect of cigarette smoke or indoor/outdoor air pollution. gLeEseezoe",6

"V hee 1108 (Vol. 9) WORKERS CAN BE ‘BRIBED’ TO LIVE HEALTHY LIFESTYLES, CONFERENCE TOLD CHICAGO — (By a BNA Staff Correspondent) — For the right price, workers can be bribed to quit ‘smoking, exercise, lower their cholesterol levels, and engage in other healthy behavior, a consulting actuary told a wellness conference here. “Let's face it, money is a motivator—even if it's 10 bucks a month,” said Stephen Brink, principal and consulting actuary for Milliman & Robertson Inc, at the Worksite Wellness Council of Greater Chicago's WellBusiness 2000 conference on Sept. 26. “As actu- aries, we know that people who have $100 deductibles use their health benefits more than those with higher deductibles. Finances are a motivator.” ‘The practice of using financial incentives and disin- centives to healthy behavior, such as dis- counted and inflated deductibles and cash gifts, is still in the experimental stages, but is gaining in popular- ity, according to Brink. Only about 2 percent of the nation’s companies have instituted such programs, which grew out of wellness programs in place at about 80 percent of US. companies, he said. ither by using a disincentive approach—taking money away—or an incentive agenda—providing cash gifts—an increasing number of employers are trying to help their workers control weight, lower blood pressure, reduce stress, promote mental health, and cut down on back problems, Brink said. Evidence is scarce on the amount of money that such programs are saving companies, Brink said. However, evidence does show that the programs are {influencing health behavior, he added. One of Milliman & Robertson's clients, Execufit of San Francisco, used incentive programs to cut high- risk smoking behavior by 50 percent, moved 20 per- ccent of high blood pressure sufferers into a low risk category, and moved 10 percent of participants af- filcted with weight problems and high cholesterol into low-risk groups, Brink said. Some companies aod state employers who have launched similar programs include Adolph Coors Co; Foldcraft; Hershey Foods Corp.; the Kansas state gov- ‘ernment; Southern California Edison Co; Sara Lee Corp; and Lutheran Health Systems. The programs range from focusing on one or two health problems to ‘a wider array of health behavior, Brink said. These involve giving employees monthly cash gifts of between $5 and $10 for maintaining healthier life- styles to penalizing workers by increasing deductibles up to $900 annually for failing to achieve health goals, he said “Positive incentives seem to work better than nega- tive incentives, but there is no conclusive evidence data on which works better,” Brink said. ""I personally think positive incentives work better than disincen- tives programs,” he added. ‘Any relatively common, high-risk behavior that can be measured and changed is a candidate for an incen- tive program, Brink asserted. 10-1 pwn ate © oF tee Pawo BNA’s EMPLOYEE RELATIONS WEEKLY In Brief: MSHA to bold bearings on hazard standard: The Mine Safety and Health Administration will hold pub- lic hearings on its proposed hazard communication standard for mines, according to a notice published in the Federal Register Sept. 25 (56 FR 48720), The standard, which was proposed last year, would require all mine operators to provide written information to loyees on th use.

"EFFECTS OF NICOTINE INJECTED INTO AND PERFUSED THROUGH THE CEREBRAL VENTRICLES OF THE CAT* ALK. Armitage, G. H. Hall, A. 5. Milton, and Cathleen F. Morrison Tobaceo Research Council Laboratories, Harrogate, England ‘The pharmacological actions of nicotine upon the central nervous syster have been studied for many years by numerous investigators (Slvette «tal. 1962). It has not always been established, however, that nicotine acts directly ‘upon the central nervous system. In addition to systemic administration, drugs have been introduced into the brain either by intracisternal or incra- ventricular injection, or by microinjection into discrete regions. In the exper- ments to be described, nicotine was injectad'into the cerebral ventricles of conscious and of anesthetized cata through a Collison cannula implanted in « lateral ventricle an described by Feldberg and Sherwood (1953). Injections were made through « rubber diaphragm in the screw cap of the cannula. In experiments upon cats anesthetized with chloralose (60-80 mg/kg intraven- ously), nicotine was either injected intraventricularly, perfused! through the carebral ventricles from a lateral ventricle to the Sylvian aqueduct, as de- seribed by Bhattacharya and Feldberg (1968), or perfused through the sub- arachnoid, space from the interpeduncular foasa to the cisterna magna, according to the method of Beleslin, Polak, and Sproull (1965). Drugs in- jected into, or perfused through the Collison cannula have access to the ‘whole ofthe lataral ventricle, enter the third ventricle through the foramen of Monro, pas via the Sylvian aqueduct to the fourth ventricle and reach the subarachnoid space through the foramina of Luschka in the lateral recesses. Some of these structures are illustrated in FIGURE 1. The fourth ventricle and subarachnoid space can be excluded from the perfusion by cannulation of the Sylvian aqueduct with polyathylene tubing. Some of the results to be de- scribed have been reported by Armitage, Milton, and Morrison (1966) and Hall and Reit (1966). Conscious Cats Injected into the cerebral ventricles, nicotine produced various effects. After 25-10 yp, there occurred blinking, narrowing of palpebral fissures, etching, vomiting, and asynchronous twitching of the ears. The pinna reflex was facilitated as well, After 30-100 ug, labored respiration also occurred, followed by panting and salivation. The ear twitching was interrupted initially for about 15 seconds, during which both ears were laid back. Sometimes there “Part of this work was carried out by G. H. Halland’ E.

"‘TANAPOLIS STAR, Jack Anderson PAGE 9 Ignoring smoking warnings Washington — The tobacco com- panies’ long. deliberate campaign to undereut government warnings on the hazards of cigarette smoking has been astonishingly successful, ac- cording to internal industry ‘doc- uments that have been suppressed by court order. ‘The Federal Trade Commission recently reported that the health ‘waming on every pack of cigarettes is ineffective, and the industry's own studies support this conclusion, But 2 federal judge acceded to the tobac- co companies’ request that doc- uments subpoenaed by the FTC be locked up. The section of the agen cey's report that discusses the doc- uments has also been withheld from the public. My associate Tony Capaccio has seen the suppressed material. One document in particular illustrates just how ineffective the govern: ment’s many warnings about ciga- Fettes have been. It is a 1977 survey by the firm of Yankelovich, Skelly and White for the Brown & Wiliam ‘son Tobaceo Corp. Here are some of its findings: * NEARLY ONE-FOURTH of the nation’s cigarette smokers do not believe that smokers die younger than non-smokers. Twenty-two percent of the gen- ‘eral population, including 32 percent of smokers, were not aware that ‘smoking increases the risk of any type of cancer. ‘* Twenty-three percent of the population (and 38 percent of smok- fers) believed the statement, “They. still haven't proven that smoking. ‘causes lung cancer.” * Thirty-eight percent of the population (and nearly half the T smokers) did not know that smoking increases the risk of heart disease. * A particularly reprehensible feature of the cigarette companies"" ‘multimilliondollar advertising cam- Paigns has been their accent on youth — devising means to hook ‘young people on the smoking habit For example, a 1975 ad plan pre- Many still do not believe that smokers die younger than non-smokers. pared for Brown & Williamson sug- ested these ways to attract “start- ers” to smoke Viceroy cigarettes, “Present the cigarette as one of the few initiations into the adult world.” * “TO THE BEST of your abili- ty, relate the cigarette to ‘pot,’ wine, beer, sex, etc.” = “Don't communicate health or health related points.” The word “Don’t was underlined for empha- sis ‘The suppressed section of the FTC report has this to add: “B&W documents show that it translated the advice on how to attract ‘start. ers"" into an advertising campaign featuring young adults in situations that the vast'majority of young People probably would experience and in situations demonstrating adherence to a ‘free and easy, hedonistic lifetyle."""" Another example of the cigarette makers’ deliberate targeting of young people is his quote from the “Through the association of Salem and its brand styles with emulatable personalities that are ‘compatible with the aspirations and styles of contemporary young adults. this important target seg. ment will be attracted to the brand. * EXECUTIVE MEMO — A former Senate aide who was accused of offering classified information to Is- Faeli officials in 1978 has been a consultant to the Defense Depart- ment and is in line for a sensitive, full-time position at the Pentagon, He is Stephen Bryen, who was work: ing for the Foreign Relations Com mittee when the charges were made A former lobbyist for the National Association of Arab-Americans swore in an affidavit that he over- heard Bryen, in Washington's Mad- ison Hotel, offer Israeli officials document ‘on Arab military bases Bryen denied any wrongdoing, and was cleared by the FBI. He is now'a consultant to Richard Perle, acting assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs. Perle said the 1978 charges were “a scahe dalous attack initiated by a pro. fessional lobbying organization 's White House budget-cutters ap parently want to dismantle the anti- Poverty Community Services Agen- cy, despite the nomination of a new CSA assistant chief. Congressional investigators also want a closer look at the agency's books.

Morris, MD, PhD, Anne-Marie Audet, MD, MS, Italo F. Angelillo, DDS, MPH, Thomas C. Chalmers, MD, and Frederick Mosteller, PhD Introduction After its fist use inthe Chicago stock- yards in 1908, chlorination of drinking water spread rapidly throughout the United States and produced dramatic reductions in mor- bidity and morality associated with water- bbome diseas.! Since then, chlorine has re- ‘mained the method of choice for water purification; itis currently added to approx: ‘mately 5% ofthe nation’s drinking water? In 1974, Rook? discovered that the combi nation of chlorine with organic compounds. in drinking water produced halogenated or- ‘ganic compounds—chioroform, in paricu- Tar. In 1975, the National Organics Recon- naissance Survey verified that chlorination by-products were a major contaminant of chlorinated surface water. The study also showed that chloroform concentration cor- relates highly with the concentrations of ‘other halogenated hydrocarbons and is, therefore, a useful indicator forthe presence ‘of these compounds. Since this finding, a plethora of epidemiological studies* have investigated possible associations between ‘consumption of chlorinated water and can- ‘er. These studies conser a wide range of populations and regions and demonstrate somewhat inconsistent pattems of associa- tion. We used metacanalytic methods to pool the results of these studies in an at- tempt to funher our understanding of the relationship berween water chlorination and neoplastic diseases. Meta-analysis provides greater statistical power and greater resolu- ‘ion inthe estimation of relative risks than so individual studies. Methods Identifcation of Relevant Studies To identify references pertaining to the relationship between chlorination of drinking water and neoplastic diseases, ‘we used the Medline data retrieval system to search the medical, public health, and biological literature from 1966 through 1991. Relevant papers were obtained and reviewed to locate additional references. ‘Because intial analyses suggested an as- sociation between chlorination and both bladder and rectal cancer, the Medline system was used to conduct a second search of the literature over the same 25- year period for papers that considered these neoplasms and mentioned water in the tile, abstract, or keywords. Only those studies that identified morbidity or mortality as well as exposure land potential confounders at the level of the individual (,e., case-control or cohort studies) were included in the meta-analy sis, Studies that considered incidence and ‘exposure at the level ofa region or com ‘munity (Le., ecological studies) were ex: cluded.

As snokers, who are more Uhely to get lung cancer than non-smokers, tend to live with smokers this misclassifcation probably exaggerated the cti- ‘mated increase in sk. Adjusoment for this error reduced the estimate to 30% (relative risk 130), But ax people who Live with son-smokers may stil be exposed to ther people's smoke his ‘esate was revised again to allow for the fact that a truly ‘nexposed reference group was not used. The increase ia ak ‘among noa-smokers ving with smokers compared with a Somoley aesposed group was ths etimated at 3% (elatie Hakor 53). “This analysis, and the fact that non-smokers breathe environ: ‘mental tobacco smoke, which contains carcinogens, into their fogs and thatthe generally accepted view is that there is no safe threshold forthe effect of carcinogens, leads to the conclision ‘that breathing other people's tobacco smoke isa cause of lung.

"The Scare— and Diversification - By FELIX F, FLUSS Daa, RYN be who analyses the U.S. manufacturers’ growing tendency to branch out into non-tobacco enterprises HE R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the biggest cigarette maker of the U.S., announced recently that it hat acquired Pacific Havaiian Products Co, a maker of cake mixes, fruit beverages and shoe- shine kits. Behind this move and other cigarette makers’ expansion of their rnon-tobacco activities are, according to the opinion of several financial analysts, some disquieting statistics, In 1962 the annual increase of cigarette consumption was the smallest since 1954. According to estimates, per-capita consumption has remained at the same level as in 1961. This contrasts with an average growth rate fof approximately 3} packs a person ‘each year from 1957 through 1961. Industrial observers claim that with this move another episode has been closed in the struggle of the U.S. tobscco industry to combat adverse publicity linking cigarette smoking with lung cancer and other diseases: Although it has been pointed out that Reynolds’ would probably hesitate to connect its diversification programme with fear for the smoking habit, it has been claimed that over the past Year or 40, and not least tince the publication in March, 1962, of the unfavourable British report on “Smoking and Health”, evidence has been mounting in the U.S. against cigarette smoking as a health hazard, In June, 1954, the American Cancer Society published a study showing certain statistical correlations between smoking and lung cancer. This was taken up by the popular Press and for the first time a “cancer scare” ensued which was reflected in a decline jn smoking that year. In the meantime the American public has repeatedly been exposed to the question of the relationship between Gigarette smoking and lung cancers 1 few weeks ago the public once again hhas been confused by conflicting ements by the American Cancer Society and the Tobacco Institute, the organisation of the U.S. tobacco industry, which through its ‘Tobacco Research: Committee sponsors a pro- ‘gramme of research into questions of Tobacco use and health. So. far $6,250,000 have been appropriated for this purpose. However, the Surgeon General of the United States last October appoin- ted a committee of leading scientists in order to obtain “a comprehensive review ofall available data on smoking and other factors in the environment that may affect health”; intimating that the public should wait until the committee presents its findings, prob- ably this summer. In 1929 Reynolds bought for a very modest. sum’ the Tin-Foil Rolling Company, now the Archer Aluminum Division. This division supplies vireu- ally all Reynolds’ foil. requirements and performs all the foil and paper colour printing. Ic sells its surplus to third parties, both inside and outside the industry. Indeed the company believes itis an important factor in the foil market During the last 10 years or so the use of aluminium foil for frozen food, for broiling and many other cooking and household purposes in the U.S. thas increased at a rapid rate. The main ‘outlets—food stores and supermarkets ‘sell packaged aluminium fol in large amounts; Reynolds has secured a sizeable shate of this market, In 1958, 185,511 short tons of aluminium fol valued at $140.5 million have been, shipped. In 1960 the value of ship- ments rose to $179.4 million. The 1961 production of the entire U.S. foilgy industry amounted to $187.7 million. ‘To meet the increased demandty Archer Aluminum Division is presently expanding the capacity of the factory by so per cent. Reynolds hopes t0 increase its proportion of sales to outside customers, now about 25 per cent. Philip Morris Inc. acquired Milprint Inc., a leading convertor of flexible packaging; a subsidiary, the Nicolet Paper Company, nicely rounded out of the line of packaging material, Sales ‘of Milprint and its subsidiary, Nicolet Paper Company, increased considerably last year; in order to meet the increased demand for its specialty papers, Nicolet last November started an expansion Programme in West DePere (Wis consin). Two buildings are in the process of being constructed and special, new machinery designed for the manufacture of glassine, grease- Proof and specialty papers has been ordered. A new supercalender for making glassine and a water treating. plant will be instrumental for an efficient production of top grade merchandise. Philip Morris acquired Polymer Industries, Inc., a producer of synthetic resin emulsions. ‘This company will build a new, modern reactor plant for the production of emulsion polymers on a 27-acre site near Greenville (North Carolina). This new facility, scheduled for completion late this yeat, reflects the growing demand for many textile yarn preparation and fin'shing products; it points to the growing position of the company in the produc- tion of textile chemicals R. J. Reynolds installed the Hunter ‘continuous casting process, whereby 4 in. aluminium sheet is’ produced directly from molten metal and rolled down into foil immediately, Further [progress in the functional uses of foil— plain, aminated or coloured—have ‘been made. ‘The operations are now integrated with the installation of the latest laminating, foil and paper colour printing and roto-gravure presses down, to the final product. As a, result, Reynolds is already selling packaging material to many more industries at an increasing rate. ‘A different kind of diversification ‘move has been made in 1960 by acquir- ing 8 51 per cent, interest in Haus 2 ah",9

"April 4, 1988 Dear Dr. Green: tn the letter of February 18, 1988, I wrote that we tequire 300 cigarettes for each type of cigarette, but I have not received them yet, So, I'd like to confirm whether the sample cigarettes will be sent to us without ordering to each supplier of the cigarettes by myself or I have to write to each supplier to send them. If the things are in time, I'd like to change the number of cigarettes from 300 to 1000 for each type of cigarettes.

"“What's Your Cancer Profile? [Smoking Does Not Necessarily Lead to Lung Cancer]"" Washington Post-Health (09/19/95) P. 12; Weiss, Rick Despite the claim that lung cancer is directly linked to smoking, about one in seven people diagnosed with the disease are nonsmokers. Although cigarettes are currently the single most preventable cause of cancer, 85% of smokers never contract lung cancer. Researchers say this may be because while one person may be especially sensitive to one carcinogen, he or she may be resistant to another, depending on the particular combination of genes the person inherited. Most carcinogens are usually benign when they are first Inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed through the skin. It is only when they come in contact with various activating enzymes in the body that the carcinogens become threatening, since some of the body's ordinary compounds can have an untoward effect on carcinogens and make them chemically unstable and electrically charged. Studies in molecular epidemiology have determined that cancer is the result of a complex interaction between gene makeup and environmental factors. ""Study: Food as a Cancer Preventive Drug [May Lower Chances of Lung Cancer}"" Washington Post--Health (09/19/95) P. 15 Scientists have found that people with an increased risk of cancer due to a lack of certain enzymes that neutralize carcinogens may benefit from foods that supply those enzymes or increase the production of those enzymes in the body. In performed on rats exposed to a cigarette carcinogen, a dose of the PEITC enzyme) an inhibitor found in watercress, caused a 50% reduction in lung tumors, according to ‘American Health Foundation director of research Stephen Hecht. Hecht said he and his researchers believe that a pill containing these types of inhibitor substances might be a way to reduce lung cancer in smokers who are addicted to cigarettes, but stressed that the best thing for people to do is to quit smoking. wa, fay Le ye pert f2tee60soz",9

This event is thought to be necessary for activation of the enzyme.

Under these conditions, phosphoinositide hydrolysis and di acylglycerol (DAG) formation are not inhibited. We also examined the time course of DAG accumulation in response to carbachol. DAG is not yet significantly elevated when the increase in [HJPDB binding is max- imal, Furthermore, [HJPDB binding has returned to control levels when DAG concentrations are maxi- mally elevated, These data suggest that hormone-stim- ulated increases in cytoplasmic Ca** cause a marked and rapid redistribution of protein kinase C which recedes uny significant increase in DAG. Our findings also demonstrate that {HJPDB binding to intact cells may be a useful measure of the ability of Ca**-mobiliz- ing hormones to affect protein kinase C. “The Cat and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (pr0- tein kinase C) exists as a peripheral membrane protein that can be readily dissociated from the plasma membrane by chelators (for review see Nishizuka, 1986).

DAG ‘and phorbol esters hind to and activate protein kinase C, causing it to phosphorylate specific polypeptide substrates ‘and, thereby, affect cellular responses. An initial consequence ‘ofphorbol ester binding to protein kinase C is that the enayme becomes more tightly associated with the plasma membrane (Kraft and Anderson, 1982), Such redistribution of protein kinase C from a loose association with the plasme membrane ‘to a more intogral association is also stimulated by Ca¥. fn vitro studies of the binding of purified protein kinase C to erythrocyte membranes reveal that Ca"" alone, or synergisti cally with phorbol esters, promotes the association of protein kinase C with membrancs (Wolf et al, 1985). Therefore, it Jhas been suggested that Cu""* plays a fole in “priming” the activation of protein kinase C. ‘The extent to which physiological changes in the intracel- Iular calcium concentration ({Ca""*}) affect protein kinase C redistribution and, thus, its activation in vivo is not well ‘understood.

Although Feacon and co-workers assessed protein kinase C distribution after stimulating intact cells with hor- mone, they measured protein kinase C activity in cell frac tions. Dougherty and Niede!

Of Louisiana's 64 parish- ts (counties). 34 had rates in the top 10 per cent nationally. ‘To update parish-specifc rates of morality attributable to RSC in Louisiana. and to investigate clustering and the sta- bility of geographic trends over time, we determined rates, for 1967-1976 Methods From death certificates signed by physicians in Louisi- ana, and supplied by the State of Louisiana. Department of Health and Human Resources, Office of Heaith Services and Environmental Quality. we obtained data on deaths resulting from RSC during 1967 to 1976 in each ofthe state's 64 parish- 5, Respiratory system cancers were represented by the 8th revision of the International Classification of Diseases code hhumbers 162-163,? which are consistent with the categories (of the 6th revision used by Mason and MeKay. Audit of Louisiana death certificates during 1967-1976 showed that approximately 94 per cent of deaths listed as caused by RSC Were reported as lung, bronchus. and trachea cancer.” We inelided the last three years of Mason and MeKay’s study in ur data to achieve more stability in our estimates of rates. ‘Age-specific denominator dats for each parish were based on the April 1972 population linearly extrapolated from the 1960 land 1970 census data, for each race and sex. We age-adjust- td the average annual rates of mortality due to RSC by the Gireet method, using the 1960 U.S. population as a stan~ dard For each parish. the observed age-adjusted average an- ual rates of mortality attributable to RSC for 1967-1976 ‘Were compared with expected rates based on the increase in the state since 1980-1969.

The lungs eated with papain showed varying degrees of emphysema asoriated with fan increase of lung compliance.

Unlike human emphysema, ‘where coexining chronic bronchitis is common, the air- ‘ways in these animals were normal except for dilatation of terminal bronchioli. Thus, this experimental prepara- tion enabled us to study the effect of emphysema, un- complicated by chronic bronchitis, on the flow-pressure- volume characteristics. MATARIALS AND ocrHoDs |A study was carried out on 39 treated animals and on 31 control animals. Of the 39 treated animals, 5 were treated with a single exposure to acrosolized papain, and the rest were treated with single or repeated intratracheal 138 | Hospital Center, Bronx, New York 10461 instilations of papain. The control animals received cither no treatment or saline treatment intratracheally ot through inhalation exposure, ‘The animals treated with saline did not show any lung pathology. The animals treated with papaia showed a massive hernorshagic in- flammatory reaction immediately after the treatment, followed by the development of emphysema. The inital inflammatory reaction subsided within 1 week. ‘The physiological measurements were made at least 1 week ater the final teatment. An example of severe eo:phy- semua produced by teatment with aerosolized papain is Showa in Fig. 1. Details of the method of production of emphysema and the pathological findings will be re- ported elsewhere (5). ‘Although the animals teated with papain lost weight temporarily, they regained weight, and the distribution of age and body weight at the tine ofsacriGce was similar in the two groups, as shown in the Table 1. Immediately after the animal was sacrificed by a lethal dose of pentobarbital, the lung was carefully removed, together with the heart, and placed in a body plethys graph with the tachea tied around a conducting tube. The plediysmograph used was similar to the one de- scribed by Mead (8) (Fig. 2). The total air volume of the plethystuograph was approximately $ liters, and a Change of volume caused a pressure change of approx mately lem H.O. The pressure change in the plethysmo- sgraph was picked up by a sensitive pressure transducer (Statham PL5-0350) a8 a volume signal. ‘The flow was obtained by electric differentiation of this volume signal. ‘The calibration of volume and flow was carried out electrically as shown in the APPENDIX ‘Using a 10-ml syringe and monitoring the inflation by the airway presure, we slowly inflated the lungs of the control group until the airway presure reached ap- proximately 20-25 cm H,O pressure.

While certain con ponents of the immune system are depressed, others are enhanced. In particular, fn increased proportion of T lymphocytes which bear Fe receptors for IgG has, been noted in older individuals (3, 4). Natural killer (NK) cells, which are Fe receptor positive lymphocytes, are believed to play a role in immunosurveillance: viral infection, and hemopoietic regulation (S, 6). In view of the higher incidence of tumors in aged humans, attempts have been made to evaluate any possible correlation between the basal NK activity and age. Also, a central question among previous (7~10) and present investigators is whether # relationship exists between human survival and the NK component of the immune system and. if so, could NK activity be a determinant for longevity?

SIEVERS, BS, WILLIAM M. ISENBERG, PuD, STANTON A. GLANTZ, PuD, FACC, WILLIAM W. PARMLEY, MD, FACC San Francisco, California Objectives. We evaluated the influence of passive smoking on experimental atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed rabbits. ‘Background. Exposure to environmental (obacco smoke (ETS) has been epidemiologicaly linked to death from ischemic heart disease im nonsmokers. ‘Methods. New Zealand raale rabbits were randomly divided Into three groups after 2 weeks of 20.3% cholesterol diet. Sixteen rabbits were exposed fo 2 high and 16 rabbits to 2 low dose of ETS; 32 rabbits located in another room served as an unexposed control group. After 10 weeks of ETS exposure, all rabbits were elle, and the percent of sortc and pulmonary artery endothelial surfaces covered by lipid lesions was measured by staining and ‘Results. Average air nicotine, carbon monoxide and total particulate concentrations were 1,040 g/m’, 60.2 ppm and 32.8 mg/m? for the igh dose ETS group, 30 g/m’, 18.8 ppm and 4.0 mg/m? for the low dose ETS group and <1 g/m, 3.1 ppm and 0.13 mg/a® for the control group. The percent atherosclerotic {involvement of the aorta and pulmonary artery increased signii- ‘cantly with ETS exposare (forthe aorta, 30 + 19% (mean # SD] for the control group, 36 = 14% for the low dose ETS grovp and 52 £ 21% for the high dose ETS group, p < 0.001; for the pulmonary artery, 22 + 15% for the control group, 29 # 25% for the low dose BTS group, and 45 + 12% for the high dose ETS. group, p < 0.001). Bleeding time was shorter im the two ETS groups than in the coatrol group (86 + 17 vs. 68 + 15, 68 + 18 s, p< 0.001). There were no significant differences in serum triglycerides, cholesterol and high density lipoprotein cho- lesterol atthe end of the study. Conclusions, Environmental tobacco smoke affects platelet ‘function and increases aortie and pulmonary artery atheresclero- ‘is, This increase of atherosclerosis was independent of changes im seram lipids and-exhibited a dose-response relation. These results are consistent with deta from epidemiologic studies demonstrating that ETS increases the risk of death due to heart disease. (J Am Coll Cardiol 1993321:228-32) Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is the term used to describe tobacco combustion products inhaled by nonsmok- ers in the proximity of burning tobacco. More than 4,000 constituents have been identified in cigarette smoke, Most exposure to ETS is from sidestream smoke emitted from the ‘burning tip of the cigarette. Sidestream smoke is hazardous because it contains high concentrations of ammonia, bea- zene. nicotine, carbon monoxide and many other carcino- ‘gens and irritants (1-3). Passive smoking involves breathing both sidestream ‘smoke that goes directly into the air from the burning tobacco products and mainstream smoke after it has been exhaled by ‘smokers. Sidestream smoke has higher concentrations of nox- editorial made by 2 Guest Eile.

It has been estimated that approximately 50 million nonswoking adults ‘over the age of 35 years ae regularly exposed to eavironmental ‘wbacco smoke. Additionally, $07 of al children live in fami- lies with one or more smokers (4. The effects of passive smoking on health have been reported to include shorvierm effets, such as exacerbation of asthma and angina, as well as Jong-term effects, such as increased tisk of lung cancer, respi- ralory tact infection and atherosclerosis (1-7). Environmental tobacco smoke adversely affects platelet function and damages arterial endothelium, and depresses cellular respiration atthe level of mitochondria (4,5). People exposed to ithave significantly thicker arterial walls than do ‘unexposed nonsmokers. and wall thickness is increased with increasing exposure (8). Passive smokers also have signifi cantly depressed bigh density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and significantly elevated ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol levels (). ‘The materials in ETS may thus accelerate the develop- ment of atherosclerotic plaque.

"FSC-236-C May 23, 1994 TO ALL FIELD SALES PERSONNEL: As explained in previous communications, there is an on-going effort by INFACT, a Boston based anti-smoking group, and possibly others, to attempt to remove CAMEL advertising at retail by threatening a consumer boycott of retail stores. We believe the target of these efforts will be, for the most part, retail chains with emphasis on the major chains and working down to the smaller ones. We expect the anti-smoking groups to approach all classes of retail including convenience, supermarket and drug. Presumably, chains who feel compelled to take action may either eliminate all CAMEL advertising from their stores or only advertising depicting Joe Camel A procedure to deal with this issue has been put in place. The first and most important part of this procedure is immediate communications if anyone in field sales becomes aware that a retailer is considering or has taken action to remove CAMEL advertising. The procedure to follow is: 41) Field personnel should immediately call their Region Operations Manager and report whatever details are available, 2) The Region Operations Manager will inform the Region Manager and the Sales Area Director of Operations. 3) The Director of Operations and the Region Manager will confer to determine what next steps are necessary. ‘The Company is prepared to defend CAMEL advertising against the unsubstantiated claims of minority groups that the advertising is targeted to under age smokers. We will respond to retailers with the facts on this issue and the business implications of our CAMEL advertising and promotion support 6SL8 6TSTS R. J. REYNOLDS TOBACCO COMPANY,",0
"SE4ANDS, CALE NOV18 Wel Sem Editorial Please quit Tomorrow, the American Cancer Society is asking the nation’s 55 million smokers to quit for a day during the fifth annual Great American Smokeout, and we ‘would like to butt in and add our plea. Volunteers have given smokers pledge cards and will ‘check back with them after the day. One ofthe local ac- tivities willbe free lung testing at Loma Linda Univer- sity. Last year, 49 percent made it through one day; 13, percent stayed ‘cold turkey” for three months; 10 per- cent were clean for six months, and 6.7 percent still weren’t smoking more than 11 months later. ‘This meant the Great American Smokeout was the impetus for more than a million Americans to per- manently quit smoking. ‘And because there is no doubt there is a definite link between smoking and lung cancer, and a definite link between lung cancer and death, the smokeout is a good Idea. ‘According to the Cancer Society, cigarette smoking is the cause of 80,000 deaths each year from lung cancer, and it contributes to the 22,000 deaths from other cancers; 225,000 deaths from heart disease and stroke; ‘and 19,000 deaths from chronic lung disease. ‘Across this page, Andy Rooney has written an ex- cellent column about how advertising makes smoking, this deadly habit, seem virile, beautiful and seductive, ‘We doon’t need to duplicate what he has already said, as there are enough other things about tomorrow's” Great American Smokeout and smoking to talk about. It seems as though the smokeout is one of those a tivities no one could attack — kind of like Thanksgiving. — because there's nothing wrong with helping people, quit. _ 2563 - sh But William D. Toohey, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute in Washington, D.C., said, “It's obviously a ‘great publicity tool for the Cancer Society as they move Into their fund-raising season, “But we think it's really a shame that they spend millions of dollars on this one-day media event when that money could be put toward scientific research to determine exactly how and why a normal healthy cell becomes cancerous. Those questions still remain unanswered and are, I think, of utmost importance to all ofus.”” So we called Mr. Toohey and asked him if he smokes. He said, “I do, and I won't be joining the smokeout because I enjoy it.” ‘Mr. Toohey may find out how some “normal healthy cells become cancerous,” if his physician ever tells him ‘his smoking has given him lung cancer. ‘There are two ways to fight cancer — find how how to stop it and find out what causes it. ‘They are equally important and the Cancer Society is: workingon both. It is ridiculous to only try and cure people when you already know how to prevent their disease. But this is what the Tobacco Institute wants, ‘And with or without the Great American Smokeout, they are seemingly getting their way. With all that advertising, 690 billion cigarettes were consumed in 1980, up 10 billion from the previous year. : ‘The number of teenage girls who smoke a pack or more of cigarettes a day has quadrupled between 1964 and 1975. An estimated six million Americans under age, ‘20smoke, 100,000 of them 12 years old or younger. . ‘Too many people are getting the wrong message — that smoking is mature, virile, tough, macho, beautiful. ‘The Great American Smokeout, in spite of all the pro- paganda from groups like the Tobacco Institute, is get- ting out the right message.

Specifically, the revisions from the preliminary request deal with a change in ""tar"" level, a reference to flavor system stability, and inclusion of the Product Request Review and Approval Board recommendations. Additionally, this will also serve to confirm our understanding with you and other menbers of the PRRA Board on two subjects related to the development of project ¥Z: 1, The Brand will be evaluating the possibility of white tipping versus cork tipping. This is a Management request and we will be working with you and MRD to resolve this issue, hopefully, in the conceptual stages. It is our understanding that it would not be a problem for you to provide prototypes utilizing both cork and white tipping for preliminary consumer screening. It is our desire to resolve this particular matter prior to the NFO testing stage. 2, TD will begin ‘an investigation into the applicability of patent coverage on either the flavor system itself or its application to the product. We would appreciate your keeping us advised as to the status of your investigation. If we can be of assistance to you in discussing this matter with Legal, please feel free to call upon us.

"N Localization of a new ferritin heavy chain sequence present in human brain mRNA to chromosome 11 5981 ‘Two types of ferritin heavy (H) chain clones have been isolated from cDNA libraries of ‘human fetal and adult brain: one corresponds to the ferritin H chain mRNA that is abundant in liver and is called “liverlike” brain cDNA; the other contains an additional 279 nucleotide (nt) sequence in the 3'untransleted region and is called brain ferritin H chain CDNA, To map the 279-nt sequence, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was carried out using DNA from rodent X human hybrid cell lines containing single human chromosomes as templates, and oligomeric primers homologous to the 3‘end of the 279-nt sequence (primer A) and to a coding sequence just 5"" to the 279-nt sequence. Significant PCR product of the size expected from analysis of the brain ferritin H chain eDNA clones and a genomic ferritin 1} chain clone (487 bp) ‘was generated only from hybrid-cell DNA containing human chromosome 11. This PCR product, land the “liver-like” brain cDNA (lacking the 279-nt sequence) both hybridized to chromosome 11 fragments that are known to define the well-characterized functional liver feritin H chain gene tnd a putative pseudogene.

Studies by the National Bureau of Standards have found that it is technically and economically feasible to develop a cigarette with less of a propensity to ignite furniture and mattresses. A fire safe cigarette can be developed by altering the porosity of the paper: using more expanded tobacco, using a filter tip, not adding citrate, and in some cases decreasing the diameter of a cigarette. Various Sombinations of these modifications would significantly reduce the likeliness of a cigarette related fire. t have introduced the Fire Safe Cigarette Act of 1987 which would authorize the development of performance standard for cigarettes- Gigarette manufacturers would then have one year to comply with this standard, Thousands of lives could be saved, and many very serious burn injuries could be prevented by enacting this legislation.

DEAN BEFUS, AND JOSEP 8. Dav: 180. Hemodynamic changes associated with anaphylaxis in parasite-sensitized rats. Am J. Physiol, 258 (Heatt Cire. Phys: fol. 27): H1126-HLLSL, 1990,—Thirty days after infection with the parasite Nipposérongyius brasiliensis, microcirculatory changes associaced with worm allergen-induced anaphylactic shock in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats were studied. Allergen ‘challenge decreased heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, ‘and cardiac output (CO) for 60 min, although CO increased markedly by 240 min. Blood flow (ml-min""™-g wet tissue"") duced to most tissues, with the exception of the kidneys, hepatic arterial, heart, and brain, for 60 mir. Depressed flow to the adrenals and enhanced flow to the kidneys, trachea, stomach, and mesentery were observed at 40 min. The percent distribution of eardiac output per gram wet tissue (%CO/g) inezeased initially to the kidneys, heart, liver, and cervical spinal cord, decteased to the spleen and cocura, and remained unchanged to other gastrointestinal tissues. ‘The %CO/g to ‘most tissues returned to normal by 60 min but decreased to the adrenals at 240 min, ‘The intestine is an important organ affected by anaphylaxis inthe rat, and the liver may participate in alleviating anaphylaxis. circulatory shock; microspheres; microcirculation; Nippostron- ‘gylus brasiliensis ANAPHYLAXIS is an immediate type of allergic reaction that ean induce either a local response in a sensitive tissue or organ or a systemic anaphylaxis, which precip- itates circulatory collapse and life-threatening shock. A ‘common feature of anaphylaxis among different species is respiratory distress and asphyxia (9), although species- specific dysfunctions of other organs have been noted Early studies of Sanyal and West (25) identified the intestine as the primary organ affected by anaphylaxis in the rat as marked hemorrhaging was observed. Species differences in the organs affected by anaphylaxis occur with right heart failure taking place in the rabbit (1), and hepatic congestion occurring in the dog (1, 15) Rats that have been infected with the nematode Nip- postronaylus brasiliensis exhibit elevated concentrations Of parasite-specific immunoglobulin antibodies (5). The intestine is the main organ affected by anaphylaxis in the sensitized rat when the rat is exposed to a single infection of N. brasiliensis (16, 17, 20). Repeated expo- ssure to the parasite, however, results in a transition from intestine to lung as the primary organ affected by ana- phylaxis organ (16, 17). When the rat is exposed to a single infection, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils #1126 are recruited to the intestinal mucosa (12), although immune and inflammatory responses occur elsewhere, €.. the trachea, spleen, and the lungs (2). Although the integrity of the intestine may be primarily affected dur- ing anaphylaxis, other as yet unidentified tissues may participate in and contribute to development of the shock syndrome. In an attempt. to more precisely define tissues that participate in a systemic anaphylactic response in the rat, we determined blood flow to a variety of tissues and. organs in animals that had previously heen sensitized to N- brasiliensis, We used radiolabeled microspheres to ‘measure regional blood flow changes, a technique that has been applied successfully to the monkey (26) and the dog (15, 29) to study changes in the cardiovascular sys- tem associated with anaphylaxis MATERIALS AND METHODS Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Canada) of an initial weight of 200-250 ¢ were maintained in filter-top cages (2-3 per cage) to minimize the possibility of other infections Animals were infected subcutaneously in the scruff of the neck with 3,000 third stage infective larvae of Nip- postrongylus brasiliensis. The larvae were collected from fecal cultures (2) and extensively washed before injec- tion. Thirty to 35 days after the initial sensitization, the anaphylactic reaction was initiated by an intravenous jection (via the penile vein with a 27-gauge needle) with 100 l of antigen containing 150 worm equivalents of homogenized N. brasiliensis, Previous studies have established that most of the worms are expelled from the animal by 2 wk after infec- tion (30). To control for the effects of a residual parasitic infection on regional blood flows, a group of infected rats (n= 5) was treated with the anthelmintic agent thiaben- dazole (Thibenzole, Merck, Sharp & Dohme) given at 80 mg/kg in aqueous suspension by stomach tube (13) Seven days after treatment with the deworming agent, blood flows and percent distribution of cardiac output (CO) were examined at 5 min after antigen challenge. Hemodynamics were studied 10 min before injecting antigen and at three time points (5, 60, and 240 min) after intravenous injection of antigen. Separate groups of rats were used for the three time points studied, Anesthesia was induced before surgery with intraperito- neal pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg body wt) and main- 0983.6185/80 $150 Copyright © 1990 the American Physiological Societe 50641690",6

Despite the tight budget caps in place and Attomey General Janet ‘Reno’s 1997 admission to the Senate Judiciary Committee that “the federal government does not have an independent cause of action [against the tobacco companies,]” the Justice Department has asked for $20 million to pursue its lawsuit. In response to questions submitted by Senator McConnell earlier this veer, the Justice Department indicated it was committed to pursuing this case regardless of whether Congress approves the $20 million budget request for the lawsuit. ‘The Appropriations Committee's Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary Subcommittee denied the Justice Department's request for funding to bring the lawsuit and included language to prohibit any significant reprogramming of funds. No effort was made atthe full committee to change these provisions. Congress should reject any attempt on the floor to add funding for this lawsuit or to allow the Justice Department to reprogram funds. Enclosed is an analysis by CSE’s educational affiliate, CSE Foundation, that details why the Clinton administration has no valid legal claim to “recoup” money from the tobacco industry. According to The Wall ‘Street Journal, applying any of the statutes the administration has discussed relying on “would require leaps of logic and backdoor strategies that offend the legal sensibilities of some career Justice Department lawyers” (May 27, 1999, p.

Received 6 July 1989/Accepted 1 October 1989 Fischer rat fibroblasts, naturally resistant to killing by the fibrotropic strain of minute virus of mice Lpacvovirus MVM(p)], became sensitive to MVM when transformed by polyomay rus. This sensitization did ‘nat involve an inerease in the pereentage of cells which synthesized viral capsid antigens or in the percentage Of cells which produced infectious virus. The addition of anti-MVM antiserum to the growth medium of ‘MVMGinfected cells had only a small effect on theic survival rates, indicating that the majority of the killing ifec of MVM occurs in a single cycle of infection, The data indicate that cell killing by MVM is independent ‘of infectious virus production and thus support the notion that the preferential cytolytic effect is affected by ‘ral eylotoxic gene products which accumulate to intolerable levels in transformed cells but not in normal ones. Fi iy, using cells transformed with polyom: 'as and genomic and subgenomic clones of polyomavirus, we showed that the extent of sensitization to killing by MVM depended on the transforming agent used. Certain parvoviruses possess the intriguing capability to destroy oncogenically transformed cells selectively in cule ture while having litle or no effect on the viability of the parental, untransformed cells. This preferential toxicity to Transformed cells may account forthe inhibition of intuced tumorigenesis (oncosuppression), reported to occur in Vivo 2.6, 8, 11, 22, 25-27). ""a variety of ells have been used to study the preferential killing effect of autonomous parvoviruses. These include tmouse 313 eels (13-15), several at lroblast cel ines (13), and human Rbroblasis and epithelial cells (3,4). A variety of transforming agents have also been used, including simian virus 40 (1, 4 10, 14, 13), avian erythroblestosis vins (3), human ras'oncogene (18), and radiation and chemical ca inogens (1,4). These studies show that (the killing efect. of transformed cells is dependent neither on the type of cell. for on the transforming agent used and (i) the preferential Killing of transformed cells is correlated with clevated expression of the viral genome. In this study, we invest- faled the question of whether the production of infectious Virus was required forthe selective iling effect of minute Virus of mice (MVM), “The Fischer rat embryo fibroblast cell line (F-11) chosen for this study is subject to astringent contact inhibition, its anchorage-independent grovih i extremely low, and it has @ very typieal broblastc appearance. These properties allow relatively easy isolation of cells with transformed pheno- types (2), The F-lLL and F-L1UVPy (polyomavirus-trans. formed F-1L1) cell lines used in this study were obtained from T.

MYM(p) iofection caused a transient and slight cytopathic effect at days 1 and 2, after which the culture recovered and a normal growth rate was resumed. In contrast, the polyomavirusetransformed deriv- ative cell lines were destroyed completely by MVM(p) infection within 24 h (Fig. 1). The total yield of infectious virus produced in polyomavirus-transformed cells was 10° to 10%-fold higher than that produced in similarly infected ‘untransformed cell lines (Table 1). This difference range in virus yield is comparable with those of other permissive! restrictive systems for MVM (9, 20, 21, 24). A subline of mouse L-cells, A9 [which is used as a standard permissive cell line for MVM(p)], was also included in all our experi ments for comparison. Table 1 shows that virus production in A9 cells was only slightly lower than in F-111/Py cells. To investigate the relationship between the killing effect and virus production, cell killing during a single cycle of infection was quantitated by using an infectious center lassay. This assay was performed as follows. At 4 h post fection the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove unattached and unabsorbed virus, trypsinized, suspended in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium containing 35 mM HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'= 2ethanesulfonic acid) buller (pH 7.3) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and counted. Serial dilutions were prepared in the above medium, poured onto 60-mm dishes Containing monolayers of § X 10° A9 indicator cell, and incubated for 4 10 8 h {0 allow all cells to attach. The monolayers were overlaid with agar, incubated for 5 to 6 days at 37°C, and then stained with 0.2% neutral red in Hanks salts solution containing 0 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.3, and 0.45% Bacto-Agar (Difco Laboratories). Plaques were counted 20 later. These assays consistently showed that the MVM(p) permissive fraction in F-111 cells was nearly identical to that found in the polyomavirus transfor mmants (Table 1), alhough the lethal effect of MVM(p) was fitch more pronounced on the latter. Furthermore, irmm nofluorescence staining revealed similar percentages of cells",6

Kessler, M.D.., the agency's ‘commissioner. The lawsuit was filed for the purpose of asking the court to declare that the FDA does not have the jurisdiction to regulate cigarettes. ""As an advertising and marketing agency, we fully agree with the tobacco companies that the Food and Drug Administration simply has no authority to regulate tobacco, nor activities related to it,"" said Roger Beahm, president of Coyne Beahm Inc. ""As we understand the FDA's proposed rules, they would have a significant effect on Our business. In addition to regulating the manufacturers, the FDA intends to regulate advertising and marketing agencies such as ours, and retailers who sell cigarettes. We believe the FDA simply does not have that authority. ""We all agree kids shouldn't smoke. If that is the objective of the FDA, these rules make it an objective designed to fail. The proposed regulations don't deal with the real factors affecting why kids smoke -- that is peer and family influences. While we recognize access is an issue, the tobacco companies are already implementing programs which research has shown to reduce underage access. It appears that rather than trying to take action which would really help keep cigarettes out of the hands of children, the FDA has decided to try to regulate not only the tobacco industry, but advertising and marketing agencies like ours, and retailers who are involved in the sale of cigarettes, We hope the FDA will reconsider, and that a truly workable plan designed to help keep cigarettes out of the hands of children can be agreed upon.” Coyne Beahm Inc. is a six-year-old advertising and marketing agency with offices in Nerth Carolina and New York.

Using ‘dominant inhibitory mutants of FGF signal transducers to disrupt the FGF-signaling pathway at the plasma ‘membrane or in the cytosol prevents animal eap blas- tomeres from expressing several mesodermal markers in response to exogenous activin. Dominant inhibitory ‘mutants of the FGF receptor, e-ras or e-raf inhibit the ability of activin to induce molecular markers of both dorsal and ventral mesoderm including Xbra, Mix! and Xnot. Some transcriptional responses to activin such as INTRODUCTION During early Xenopus development, cells in the equatorial region of the embryo adopt a mesodermal fate in response to inductive signals emanating from the underlying endoderm. As ‘mesodermal subtypes are regionally specified during this process and since mesoderm plays a critical role in gastrula ‘movements and neural induction, undestanding the nature of the inductive signals and their response is erucial 19 under- standing the molecular basis of pattern formation. ‘Several growth factors have been identified that can induce ‘mesoderm in explanted animal pole cells (animal caps) (reviewed 1989; Whitman and Melton, 1989). Two such factors, bFGF and activin, are present in the embryo during the time of mesoderm induction (Asashima et a., 1991; Kimelman et al., 1988; Slack et al., 1987). In animal cap assays, both FGF and low concentrations of activin are capable of inducing ventrolateral mesoderm such as mesenchyme, kidney and muscle, while only high concentrations of activin can efficiently induce dorsal mesodermal tissues such as notochord (Green ct al, 1990; Slack et al., 1987; Sokol et al., 1990). A wide variety’ of mesodermal response genes have been identified during revent years, many of which can be induced by either PGF or activin, These include Xbra (Smith etal, 1991), Xhox3 (Ruiz i Altaba and Melion, 1989), Xion (Costa et a, 1991) and Xn (von Dassow etal 1993) However, a subset of mesodermal marker genes, such as oosecoid (Cho etal, 1991) and Mex! (Rosa, 1989), appear 10 respond only to activin. Marker genes that respond solely 10 goosecoid and Xwni8 are inhibited less effectively than ‘others, however, suxuesting that there may differing requirements for an FGF signal in the responses of mesoderm-specific genes to activin induction. Despite the requirement for this signaling pathway during activin induction, downstream components ofthis pathway are not activated in response to activin, suggesting that activin does not signal directly through this pathway. Key words: activin, FGF, mesoderm induction, signal transduction, Xenopus dermal markers, this suggests an apparent redundancy between PGF und low level activin signaling, ‘The receptors for FGF and activin have been cloned and ‘encode a protein tyrosine kinase and a protein serine/threonine kinase, respectively (Lee et al., 1989, Matthews and Vale, 1991), Expression of dominant inbibitory mutants of these receptors has been shown to block ligand-mediated signaling, and this effect is rescued by co-expression of wild-type receptor, indicating that these receptors are indced responsible For inductive responses in embryonic cells (Amaya etal, 1991; Hemmati-Brivanlou and Melton, 1992). In embryos, expression of a dominant inhibitory PGF receptor percurbs posterior axial patterning (Amaya et al, 1991), while expression of a dominant inhibitory activin receptor can, in the most severe cases, completely block the formation of ‘mesoderm (Hemmati-Brivaniou and Melton, 1992). The latter result is striking in light of the fact that FGF-signaling pathways are stil functional in these embryos, Indeed, animal cap explants expressing a dorninant inhibitory activin receptor show increased responsiveness to exogenous FGF (Hemmati- Brivanlou and Melton, 1992), making the lack of FGI mesoderm in embryos expressing the dominant inhibitory activin receptor puzzling. ‘These results suggest that although FGF is capable of inducing mesoderm in animal cap assays. it may not do so in whale embryos. ‘One approach to elucidating the roles of FGF and activin during mesoderm induction is to examine and manipulate the cealy cytosolic responses to these growth factors. The activin receptor belongs t a novel family of (ransmembrane serine/threonine kinases and litte progress has becn made toward understanding how these receptors transmit signals",6

CRITIQUE Justice, Science, and the “Bad Guys” When accused of a new offense, does someone regarded asa “bad guy"" have the right to due process and a fair trial? If such a right is inberent in the legal systems of civilized society, isitalso a pant of justice in the “courts” of scientific evaluation? I ask these questions because, in private conversation, I re- cently heard an authoritative leader in the world of public health epidemiology make the following statement: “Yes, it's rotten science, but it's in a ‘worthy cause. It will help us get rid of cigarettes and become a smoke-free society.” ‘The statement, of course, referred to the data and ‘evaluations assembled in the past few years for ac- cusations about what is formally called environ- ‘mental tobacco smoke and informally designated as passive smoking. According to the accusations, this, type of exposure causes at least 2 of the prime evils hitherto attributed to direct smoking: lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. In fact, several of the recent cardiovascular studies found risks that were even higher for passive smokers than for direct smokers. (The authors tactfully refrained, however, from stating the implicit conclusion that people who cannot avoid passive exposure should lower their risk by beginning to smoke directly.) A new part of the current indictment is the claim ‘that passive smoking is responsible for respiratory and otologic difficulties in children. Because young children so rarely engage in direct smoking, pedia- tricians have hitherto had little participation in the research industry devoted to studying cigarettes. Now, with open hunting season declared on the ef- fects of passive smoking in children, a fertile new opportunity has arisen for selfless public service, fame, grants, and publications. ‘Nevertheless, if the science is as “rotten” as the public health authority admitted, does the end really Justify the means? If objectivity, precautions against bias, and careful operating guidelines are essential for a “bad guy” to get fair treatment in a court of law, should those principles be abandoned or abol- ished when the “bed guy” is in a court of science? A peripheral inspection, without any in-depth ap- praisals, of the current accusations about passive smoking would suggest that many scientific prin- ciples have vanished. I shall cite 3 overt examples: 1) Many of the pediatric researchers seem un- ‘aware of the frequent disparity between symptoms and objective evidence ofailmeats whenever people are passively exposed to a “bad guy.” Perhaps the mont striking demonstration of this phenomenon STIGST SFOS",6

Toxlelty required the Integrity ‘of both the VP16 acidic activation domain and the GALA DNA-binding domain, suggesting that Inhibition resulted from trapping of general transcription factors ‘at genomic sites. Mutations that break the Interaction between GAL4-VP16 and general factors would allev!- ate toxlelty and identity transcriptional adaptors, it ‘adaptors bridged the interaction between activators ‘and genoral factors. We thus identified ADA1, ADA2, ‘and ADA3. Mutations in ADA2 reduced the activity of GAL4-VP16 and GCN4 In vivo. ada2 mutant extracte ‘exhibited normal basal transcription, but were defec- tive in responding to GALS-VP16, GCN&, or the dA:aT activator. Strikingly, the mutant extract responded ike wild type to GAL4-HAP4. We conclude that ADA2 po- tontlates the activity of one class of acidic activation domain but not a second class. ‘Transcription of eukaryotic genes often requires sites that fact at great distances from the promoter, termed en- hhancors in mammalian co's (Banerj etal. 1981; Moreau aL. 1981) and UASS in yeast (Guarente etal, 1982) Enhancers or UASs are bound by transcriptional activator proteins that contain two functional domains, one that die- {ales ONA binding, and a second that activates transcrip- tion (Brent ang Ptashne, 1985) The uctivation domains of several yeast activators are characterized by a high con- tent of acigic amino acids (Hope and Struhl, 1986; Ma and Ptashne, 19872). Activation domains from metazoans are ‘of several classes, including acidic, glutamine rich, and proline rich. The acidic activators, such as yeast GALA, will activate transcription in many eukaryotic organisms, Including mammals (Ptashne, 1988). Thus, the mecha: nism by which acidic activation domains funetion must be conserved in most or all eukaryotes. Metazoan acidic activators can work in yeast, while nonacidic activators ‘such 8s the glutaminevich activator, Spt (Courey and 50661561 ‘Tian, 1988), appear not to function in yeast (8. Pita ane L Guarente, unpublished data), ‘Acentral question in eukaryotic transcriptions how act- vators can transmit their signalto the general transcription factors that comprise the transcription initiation complex, ‘even when the activator binds to DNA at significant di- 0S from the initiation ste. Several mechanisms have ‘been proposed for activation ata distance. none model, ‘activators are thought to prevent the repressive effect of histones on promoters. n vito studies show that the mag- ‘nitude of activation is actualy increased ifthe transcription ‘wactioniscaried out in competition wth the assembly of the DNA template into chromatin (Workman etal, 1991; Leybourne and Kadonaga, 1991). This increase in the ‘magnitude of activation is due toa strong repression of the basal levelof the in vitro transcription reaction by chroma- tin. In yeast cells, a reduction inthe synthesis of histones 3 and H4 results inthe partial activation of several cellu- Jar genes Han and Grunsiein, 1989) These in vio andin Vivo studios suggest that histones are required to repress. basal transcriptontoavery owleveland hat acidic activa tion domains can counteract this repression. Howover, activators are also capable of functioning by ‘amechanism that does not involve histones. Invitro, even. ‘when the ONA template has not been assembiedinto chro- ‘matin, activation is stil robust, This fact has been shown ‘leartyin both mammalian and yeastinvirosystems.using the GAL4-VP16 fusion protein (Sadowski et al. 1988) in which the acidic activation domain of the herpes simplex.

These general factors include the TATA box-bind- Ing protein (TBP) inthe TFIO rection, as well as TFIA, “£,-F,-G,-Hy,J, and RNA polymerase! the absence fof any activator, the general factors will cary out basal transcription in viro (Matsui tal, 1980).

Because the general factors bindto the TATA box- Initiation region of the promoter in an ordered pathway (Buratowskiet a. 1989). any one of these factors couldbe the target of activators In fac, chromatographic studies indicated a direct interaction between the acicic acivation domain of VPIG and TBP (Stringer et al., 1980; Ingles ot aL, 1991).

The 24-kilobase TRAP-1 ‘mRNA was variably expressed in skeletal muscle, liver, heart, brain, kidney, pancreas, lung, and placenta. ‘TTRAP-1 mRNA was also detected in each of eight differ- cent transformed cell lines. Identification of TRAP-1 may be an important step toward defining how TNFR-1, ‘which does not contain protein tyrosine kinase activity, ‘transmits its message to signal transduction pathways. ‘Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)* is produced predominantly by macrophages activated by infections or malignancies (1-3). ‘This potent multifunctional cytokine was frst characterized by its ability to induce the hemorehagic necrosis and regression of cancers in animals and by the cytotoxic response that it ean clict from transformed cells in vitro.

Such diverse and pro- foundly important functions have made TNF the subject of intense investigation. ‘The fist step in TNF action is binding to specific receptors that are expressed on escentially all cells (4~7). Two TNF receptors have been identified as proteins of 55-kDa (the type 1 receptor, TNFR-1) and 75-kDa (the type 2 receptor, TNFR-2) (8-11), and their DNAs have been cloned (12-14). The extra- cellular domains of the TNF receptors share homologies with ‘one another and with a group of eell surface receptors that, include the FAS antigen, the low affinity NGF receptor, the ‘murine cDNA clone 4-1BB from induced helper and cytolytic T call, the B cell surface antigen CD40, the OX40 antigen of activated CD4-positive rat lymphocytes, and the T2 antigen of the Shope fibroma virus (15). The intracellular domains do not display sequence similarities and couple to different signal transduction pathways, For this reason, the receptors induce distinct responses: TNFR-1 promotes cytotoxicity, fibroblast proliferation, antiviral responses, and the host defense against ‘microorganisms and pathogens (10, 16-19), TNFR2 plays a role in cytotoxicity that ia sil being defined (2022), inhibits early hematopoiesis (28), is involved in the proliferation of ‘monocytes (24), and promtotes the proliferation of cells (28). ‘Neither TNF receptor contains intrinsic protein tyrosine ki- nase activity or any recognizable motif (1214), which suggests ‘2 mechanism through which the signal inherent in the hor- ‘mone-receptor complex can be transmitted to signaling mech- ‘anisms, This may suggest that associated proteins, rather than ‘the intracellular domain of either TNF receptor, act as essen- ‘al elements in signal transmission, Such accessory molecules may be cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, exemplified by JAK2, ‘which interacts with the erythropoietin and other receptors (28), or non-tyrosine kinases, such as gp180, which associates with the interleukin-6 and other receptors (27). Consistent with the hypothesis that TRAPS may be important to TNF action are recent reports deseribing co-precipitation of TNFR-1 ‘vith a protein kinase activity (28, 29). The present studies were initiated to identify proteins that associate with the intracel- ular domain of TNFR-1 (TNFR-1IC) and might then initiate sljaal transduction. ""To address this problem, we used the yeast-based two hybrid system, a method for studying protein-protein interactions (30, ‘30. This method is based on the properties of the yeast GALA protein, which consists of separable domains that mediate DNA binding and transcriptional activation. Plasmids encod- ing two hybrid proteins, one consisting of the GALA binding domain (GALA-BD) fused to protein X and the other consisting of the GALA activation domain (GAL4-AD) fused to protein Y, are cotransformed into yeast. Interaction between these pro- teins permits transcriptional activation ofan integrated eopy of the GALAlacZ reporter gone. ""To identify proteins that interact with TNFR-IIC, a plasmid 3574",6

"Cultured Endothelial Cells Produce a Heparinlike Inhibitor of Smooth Muscle Cell Growth : JOHN |. CASTELLOT. Jk., MARY L. ADDONIZIO, ROBERT ROSENBERG, AND MORRIS | KARNOVSKY Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts O2115, and the Sidney Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, Assteact Using cultured cells from bovine and rat aortas, we have examined the possibility that endothelial cells might regulate the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells. Conditioned medium from confluent bovine aortic endothelial cells inhibited the proliferation of growth- arrested smooth muscle cells. Conditioned medium from exponentiat endothelial cells, and from exponential or confluent smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, did not inhibit smooth muscle cell growth. Conditioned medium from confluent endothelial cells did not inhibit the growth of endothelial cells or fibroblasts. In addition to the apparent speciticity of both the producer and target cell, the inhibitory activity was heat stable and not atfected by proteases. 1 was sensitive to Flavabacterium heparinase but not to hyaluronidase or chondroitin sulfate ABC lyase. It thus appears to be a heparinlike substance. Two other lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, a crude isolate of glycosaminoglycans (1CA-soluble, ethanol-precipitable material) from endothelial cell-conditioned medium reconstituted in 20% serum inhibited smooth muscle cell growth; glycosaminoglycans isolated feom unconditioned medium (ie, 0.4% serum) had no effect on smooth muscle cell growth. No inhibition was seen if the glycosaminoglycan preparation was treated with heparinase. Second, exogenous hepatin, heparan sultate, chondroitin sulfate B (detmatan sulfate), chondroitin sulfate ABC, and hyalu- ronic acid were added to 20% serum and tested for their ability to inhibit smooth muscle cell growth. Heparin inhibited growth at concentrations as low as 10 ng/ml, Other glycosamino- Blycany had no effect at doses up to 10 ug/ml. Anticoagulant and non-anticoagulant heparin were equally effective at inhibiting smooth muscle cell growth, as they were in vivo following endothelial injury (Clowes and Karnovsk. Nature (Lond.). 265:625-626, 1977; Guyton etal. Circ Res. 46:625-634, 1980), and in vitro following exposure of smooth muscle cells to platelet extract (Hoover et al. Circ, Res. 47:578-583, 1980). We suggest that vascular endothelial cells may secrete a heparinlike substance in vivo which may regulate the growth of underlying smooth muscle cells A characteristic feature of the normal, healthy arterial wal is that the intimal endothelial cells fare a continuous quiescent ‘monolayer. and the underlying medial smooth musele cells alo remain im a quiescent growih state. I the endothelium 1s damaged. smooth muscle cell proliferation accuts until the «endothelium regenerates (9,29), The regulation of cell growth in the vascular wall ts poorly understood. Ross (1S. 28) and ‘thers (10, 25) have shown that platelet-derived growth factors are tequired for smooth muscle cell growth in vive and in vith. Recenily. conditioned medium fiom macrophages has been found to stimulate smooth muscle cells (23). Gajdusek et a a2 (11) have shown that endothelial cells produce a factor which stimulates the grossth of smooth muscle cel.

"Corner on Research The Health Realization Approach to Resiliency By BONNIE BENARD Far West Laboratory for Educational RED In his chronicle of the lives of people struggling during the Great Depression, Let Us Now Praise Fa- rus Men, james Agee wrote: ""In every child who is born, under no matter what circumstances, and no matter what parents, the potentiality of the human race is born again.” No words better summarize the belief system inherent in the resiliency paradigm. It is a belief system that manifests itself in the follow- ing words to a child or youth: “You can be who you ‘want to be; you can achieve your dream: I believe in, 7°. Tpese words communicate that powerful protec: tive factor, high expectations, which the child then internalizes as self-efficacy. The result is not only motivation but a sense of purpose and bright fu- ture—enother attsbute of the resilient person. How- ‘ever, many youth hear the opposite message in their famlies, schools, or communities: “You're not good enough: your family’s ‘at risk’; your sex, race, cul- ture, or ethnicity are not good enough: you'll never amount to anything,” These negative words create interralized thoughts of impotence, such as: “I'm ‘not good enough there’s no reason to try; things will never change’”—words reflecting not only loss of motivation but loss of Unforuinately, the number of youth growing up ‘with no sense of a bright future is increasing at an. alarming rate. As one journalist states: “Youthful ‘America’s vision of its own future has never been more dire, particularly in the cities, As one 17-year- old African American put it on his way into court ‘T been dead since Iwas 12, s0 I'm not afraid of dying, T'm just waiting to get kicked into the grave’ ” (Vo gel, 1994). I'd lke to share with you an approach that has demonstrated effectiveness at facilitating the devel- opment within youths or adults of the belief that they are innately resilient—that they have the cape ity to develop caring relationships, to solve their ‘own problems, to feel good about who they are, and tobe optimistic about their future. While I've writ- ten previously about the Health Realization model developed by Roger Mills (see Benard and Lorio, 1991; Linquant, 1992), Tam continually impressed by the growing number of practitioners—in the From Wester Center News, December 1994, Vol.8, No. 1 fields of addiction, education, community organiza- tion, community policing, organizational develop- ment, therapy, and counseling —using this approach across the country in schools, community-based 0 {gonizations, housing projects, treatment centers, hes- Pitals, businesses, and communitywide collabora- ions. I'd like to discuss Health Realization as applied resiliency, that is, how this approach integrates and iMustrates our resiliency model, which is grounded in developing environments rich inthe protective factors of caring, high expectations, and opporturi- ties for participation in order to foster the individual traits of resilience: social competence, problem-solv- ing, autonomy, and sense of Bright future. Finally, ‘welll discuss what the Health Realization approach offers the field of prevention and early intervention. ‘The Health Realization approach evolved from the application of the principles of a new wellness paradigm in psychology, Psychology of Mind, to the prevention, early intervention, and community de- ‘velopment arenas. Health Realization began in the late 1980s with a demonstration project in a Dade County, Florida, housing project beset with the ef- fects of poverty and racism: violence, drug-dealing, domestic violence, teen 7 and school fail- ure. Today, Health Realization is demonstrating its effectiveness not only in dramatically reducing the rates ofall these problems but also in building a serise of community pride and well-being in commu- nities across the nation. Some of the findings from pre-and juations of the 142 families and 604 ‘youth involved in the three-year Dade County pro- ject include significantly improved parent-child rela- tionships in 87 percent of the families, a75 percent reduction in delinquency and school-related prob- Jem behaviors, a 65 percent decrease in drug traffick- ing, an 80 percent decrease in teen pregnancy, and a 60 percent decrease in substance abuse. Recent find- ings from the one-and-a-half year Coliseum Gardens Project in Oakland, California, include a cessation of all gang warfare and ethnic clashes between the ‘Cambodian and African American youth, 45 per- cent reduction in violent crimes (and no homicides since the project began), and a 110 percent increase in youth involvement in the Boys and Girls Club.

"iru eed Ere ek She plays matchmaker for products, markets NEW YORK — Faith Pop- corn’s career has been built on positioning.” She tells companies how to make their new products click with the right group of consum: ers, of how t0 take their old, blah products and “restage” them with fresh promises for different target markets She's done it for dozens of products you'd recognize in a second — if she could tell you what they are, which, contrac: tually, she usually can't. As a result, the president of Brain- Reserve has kept a fairly low profile for nine years. No more."" Her struggle between carefully cultivated ‘anonymity seems finally to be at an end, For example, lately she has been publicly predicting the fu ture, which tends to draw at- tention to a person. ‘And telling The CocaCola Co, that its marketing strategy is all wrong — as Popcorn also hhas done, strictly uninvited — {is no way to be inconspicuous, Her wardrobe.

They were burned, and when they learn through burn they don’t forget.” These, she says. are the days — one who demands intelli: gent, high-quality products and advertising that gives real in- formation about what the prod- uct does, For example, she says, Coca: Cola will find tnat consumers will greet a jingle like ""Coke is it! with “Coke is what?” Kellogg Co.. she says ‘should get to the point: Cora Flakes is a healthy and nutri tous breakfast.” And so on.

Thus, in Ceylon the young men who smoke Beedi cigarettes are said to be par. ticularly prone to occlusive diseases of the small arteries, A study of the Buerger syndrome in Korea revealed that the patients smoked a coarse form of locally grown tobacco"".

Presumably, these poor people smoke the locally grown ‘and locally manufactured cigarettes most often since they are the cheapest available In a recent epidemiological study of a large number of patients with the Buerger syndrome in Indonesia the patients Were found 10 smoke cigarettes of three basic types*. The commonest was *Kawung’, the tobacco of which is grown, air cured and prepared at home by the patients or their neigh. bours. It is a coarse form of tobacco rolled in a tissue made from the leaves of the sugar palm and is the cheapest type of ete available in Indonesia, ""Kretek° cigarettes are made from a better quality, commercially available tobacco mixed. with cloves and spices and wrapped in a normal tissue as used in Western cigarettes. “Western’-type cigarettes were also ‘smoked by these poor patients as were also conglomerates of tobacco removed from discarded cigarette butts and remanuc factured by some enterprising merchant.

The state flow chart is derived feom a ‘mathematical model of Buerger's disease and the theoretical aspeats are detailed elsewhere.

Several members of our staff are now even more enthusiastic about the chances of success in developing a combustionless cigarette. Undoubtedly this is an opportune time to introduce such a product to the market.” We have planned a new research program for your consideration. Four copies are attached. The proposed ntodified program covers two phases: (1) development of a tar-free formulation to be aerosolized to pro- duce simulated cigarette smoke acceptable to smokers and (2) development of a pneumatically actuated metering valve. A third phase consisting of the development of the complete package resembling a regular cigarette would be Proposed following the successful conclusion of Phases 1 and 2. You can authorize us to start work immediately by returning one signed copy of our standard research agreement, two copies of which are attached, We will, of course, be happy to discuss the proposed study with you in detail, We would certainly welcome your visiting Battelle to meet with some of us who would be involved in the research.

DeLa Cadena, and Robert W. Colman From the Thrombosis Research Center, Tomple University Schoo! of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA igh molecular weight kininogen (HK), a single chain plasma glycoprotein, serves asa cofactor inthe contact system of| blood coagulation. After cleavage by human plasma kallikrein, the nonapeptide bradykinin is released. The HK light chain (LC) contains coagulant activity, which requires both the ability to bind ‘the contact system 2ymogens, prekallikrein and factor Xl, and the ability toi tively charged surfaces. Since bacterial expression m uccessful if carbohydrate was required for activity, we evaluated that possibility by incubating plasma HK with endoghyvosyase F Although the procedute removed tecable N-linked carbohydrate, no change in specific activity ‘carted. We then developed a bacterial expression system (0 produce recombinant HK LC. The DNA coding for the HK LC ‘was prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and Put, and introduced into the ‘bacterial expression vector pKK223-3. E.colt harboring this recombinant plasmid (pSK1) expressed HK LC upon induction with isopropytthiogaactoside (IPTG). The recombinant protein 27 kDa), when transferred onto a PVDF membrane, was recog: nized by monospecific polyclonal anti-HK LC-antibodies. The fecombinant HK LC was purified by heparin agarose atfinity chromatography to homogeneity and found to have a specific activity of 28 coagulant units per me protein, similar to the specific activity of the LC derived by proteolytic digestion of hhumian plasmia HK. We conclude: 1) The HK LC synthesized in bacteria is biologically active, and 2) the 40% carbohydrate content of the HIK LC is not require for its cofactor activity Introductory Statement Normal human plasma contains two different forms of kinino- ens ~ low molecular weight kininogen (LK) and high molecular weight kininogen (HK) derived from a single gene by differential splicing (1). Toth kininogens are single chain glycoproteins containing the identical amino terminal heavy chain, and bradyki nin, but unigue earhoxyterminal light chains. ‘The plasma con- ceniration of HK i 70-90 yt and of LK is 200-260 pesmi (2-4). Both prekalikrein (PK) and factor XI (FX1) circulate in plasma complexed to HK (5-7). In plasma, kallikrein cleaves both HK and LK and releases bradykinin, a potent vasodilator, The remsining portion of the kininogens are held together by a Single disulfide bond between the heavy chain (M, 62,000) and the light chain of LK (4, 4,000) or the light chain of HK (M, 56,000) “The S6 kDa light chain of the HK (LC 1) is further cleaved to a 445 kDaalight chain (LC 2) by kallikrein. The heavy chain contains ‘qsteine protease inhibitory domains, while the LC of HK coninins the anionic surface binding domain, the region binding the 2ymogens, PK and FXI (8-10) and a heparin binding site.

Factor Xila, generated by reciprocal activation of prckalikrein and factor XU, initiates the itrinsc Blood coagulation pathway (15) by converting FXI to factor Xta.

A monoclonal antibody, CIICI, developed against the HK LC in our laboratory has been shown to inhibit the coagulant activity ofthe HK (19) by blocking essential residues required for the binding of HK to negatively charged surfaces (20). However, attempis to characterize the domains for anionic surface binding and to identify the mAb epitope have been limited by the laborious purification and low yield of the alkylated light chain of HK and the need to perform extensive proteolytic modifications. Moreover, although HK contains 40% ‘ofits mass as eorbohydrate, the funtion ofthese side chins i currently unknown. Hence, we adopted the recombinant DNA, approach to produce light chain of HK to study steeture-function relationships.

"ag ser We R & D Dept. Dor /ArB/ 10th September, 1982 Dr. P.J.C. Ro 19 Marryatt Road, Wimbledon Common, LONDON, SW19 SB. Dear Francis, . Both the question to BMJ and your answer seem to be Predicated-on the tacit assumption that everyone smokes for Bicotine, and only for this. I think that your answer could, with advantage, include the thought that, for some gmokers at least - and, Perhaps, particularly heavy smokers - the habit is indulged in tor psychological reasons as much as for pharmacological ones. To be anecdotal for a moment, I find that I frequently reach for a cigarette whenever I answer the telephone, even if I am already smoking! Repetition of an ingrained habit in this way provides a mental stimulus. Chewing a piece of Nicorette gum just won't be the same thing and won't give the same result, The question doesn't say what is the level of tar and nicotine in the cigarettes, which must surely have some bearing on the nicotine content of the Nicorette gum to be chewed. (Incidentally, your answer refers to “sucking” the gum, TI believe it has to be thoroughly masticated to release the buffered nicotine to the subject.) Russell's most recent Paper in BMJ suggests that at least some smokers adjust their smoking behaviour (puff volume, duration, etc.), in order to obtain satisfaction from a tar intake, rather than from nicotine. Por these people, Nicorette chewing gum may well be an inadequate surroga’ Seeczerosz",0
"eel Suppression of Vinculin Expression by Antisense Transfection Confers Changes in Cell Morphology, Motility, and Anchorage-Dependent Growth of 3T3 Cells Ads. c14 José Luis Rodriguez Fernéndez,* Benjamin Geiger,* Daniela Salomon,* and Avri Ben-Ze'ev"" * Departments of Molecular Genetics and Virology and ¥Che Rehovot, Israel Abstract. ‘The expression of vinculin, a major com- ponent of adhesion plaques and cell-cell junctions, is ‘markedly modulated in cells during growth activation, Gifferentiation, motility and cell transformation. The stimulation of quiescent cells by serum factors and the culturing of cells on highly adhesive matrices induce vinculin gene expression, whereas the transformation of fibroblast and epithelial cells often results in de- ‘creased vinculin expression (feviewed in Rodriguez Ferndndez, J. L., B. Geiger, D. Salomon, T. Sabanay, M. Zaller, and A. Ben-Zeev. 1992. J. Cell Biol. 119:427), To study the effect of reduced vinculin ex- pression on cell behavior, 313 cells were transfected ‘with an antisense vinculin cDNA construct, and clones displaying decreased vinculin levels down to ICROFILAMENTS are major cytoskeletal compo- M en of evar els nvoled in determining cell shape, dynamics, and adhesion. At cell junc- ‘ions ether with other cells, or with the extracellular matrix (ECM),! microfilaments are linked to transmembrane re- ceptors ofthe cadherin and integrin families by cytoplasmic adherens junction (AJ) plaque proteins (Burridge et al., 1988; Geiger and Ginsberg, 1991; Tukitaet al, 1992). Vi calling a major and ubiquitous, AJ plaque component (Gei- get, 1979, 1989; Burridge et al., 1988), whose complete se- {quence (Cotou and Craig, 1988; Price etal, 1989) and the protein domains involved in its interaction with other junc- tional proteins were determined (Bendori etal, 1989; Jones etal, 1989; Westmeyer et al., 1990). White vinculin belongs to the group of “household” struc~ tural proteins, its expression may be modulated in a variety of cell types in culture and in vivo. For example, cultured fibroblasts regulate vinculin mRNA and protein synthesis in response to changes in cell contacts and shape (Ungar etal. 1986; Bendor et al., 1987).

"RJ. Reynolds Tobaceo Company Statement in Response to Dr. Kessler Subcommittee on Health and the E 's Appearance before U.S, House of Representati vironment, Committee on Energy and Commerce June 21, 1994 IL was apparent today that nicotine levels in cigarettes and the use of ammonia in processing tobacco are of great interest to the Food and Drug Administration, When they visited RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company facilities andl talked to our sta this spring, the FDA stall did not ask about our use of ammonia, Had they, or anyone clye, asked we would have been glad to tell them that: Ru. Reynolds Tobacco uses only & minuscule amount of ammonia as a processing agent in only ‘one aspect of its production ~ the formation of reconstituted sheet tobacco, # We use such low amounts of ammonia, that none of it remains in the final sheet product + Ammonia occurs naturally in tobacco, and the amount found in smoke is the same in sheets processed with or without ammonia, + In fact, our analysis of the nicotine in smoke or the transfer rate into smoke indicate there is no Gifference between sheet tobacco made with or without the ammonia processing agent + As Dr. Kessler’ statement indicates, the result of using ammonia as a processing agent is to reduce the sugar content in tobacco, which smoothes out the taste. + In addition, the use of ammonia as a processing agent reduces certain controversial smoke constituents identified by the Surgeon General None of today’s testimony changes the fact that the use of reconstituted sheet is a technique t0 reduce ""tar"" and nicotine in cigarettes. We could stop using those techniques, But the consequence of doing that would be a return to the 1940's, when the average cigarette yielded 40 milligrams of ""tar"" and 2.8 milligrams of nicotine -- more than three times what the average is today. According lo the 1989 Surgeon General's Report, sinee 1957 ""tar"" and nicotine have been reduced by 60%. Al this information has been available to the government and the American people for fully 50 ‘years and in published government documents 20 years ago. If Mr. Waxman and Dr. Kessler’s goal is to eliminate adult Americans’ ability to choose to smoke, they should, as our chairman, James W.

To evaluate the importance of this recycling. pathway in greater detail, we examined the internali- zation and reveling of cell surface glycoproteins on EL-4 cells, a murine T-cell lymphoma, using sialic acids as covalent markers. Sialic acids were removed from the surface of living cells by exhaustive treatment with Vibrio cholerae sialidase at 4 °C and shown to be derived primarily from glycoproteins (93%), with only. ‘4 small amount from glycolipids (7%). Cells were r cultured at 37 °C over time and monitored for the resialylation of the cell surface using a sensitive high pressure liquid chromatography adaptation of the thio- barbituric acid assay for sialic acids. The return of sialic acid to the cell surface was found to be contingent ‘upon de novo protein synthesis indicating that the bulk of plasma membrane sialogiycoconjugates do not re- eycle to an endogenous sialyltransferase-containing compartment for oligosaccharide reprocessing. Iden~ tical results were found for K562 cells, a human eryth roleukemia cell lin ‘The movement of specific glycoproteins was followed using the enzyme rat liver a2~GGald1-4GIeNAc sialyl- transferase together with CMP-[*H)NewAc as an im- bermeant probe of the cell surface, Surface sialogly- coproteins were internalized slowly, a process unal- fected by eyeloheximide treatment. Only a few of tese internalized glycoproteins were found to return to a trans-Golgi compartment followed by reeyeling to the cell surface. Taken together, these data indicate that the majority of replacement of sialic acids on the cell surface is due to de novo synthesis of glycoproteins and that only a small number of glycoproteins recycle through a trans-Golgi compartment.

Partment through which newly synthesized as well as inter- ‘alized proteins pass (reviewed in Farquhar, 1985; Fishman ‘and Fine, 1987; Griffith ca, 1986; Herzog, 1961; Romagnoli and Herzog, 1987; van Douts vt al, 1988; Yamashiro etl. 1984). ‘The internalization ot plasma membrane glycoproteins and their subsequent return zo the cell sueface has beon observed in many laboratories (reviewed in Brown eta, 1989; Fishman ‘and Cook, 1986). At present, both the mechanisms which induce the internalization of cell surface glycoproteins and the intracellular pathways they may take are unclear. For example, the igand-induced endocytosis of cell surface recep. tors has been shown to include the return of some of these 78 to the cell suciace atter deposition of ligand in an intracellular compar ment (reviewed in Goldstein et a, 1985). However, binding ut specific ligand may not be the sole signal for internalization, Endocytosis of receptors for trans- ferrin, low density lipoprotein, «,-macroglobaiin, T-lympho. exte antigens (T3/Ter), and asialoglycoproteins has been demonstrated to occur in the absence of corresponding ligand. (Ajioka and Kaplan, 1985: Anderson et al, 1982; Kaplan and Keogh, 1981; Krangel, 1951; Schwartz et al, 1984; Watts, 1985). The specific itinerary followed by an internalized recep. tors another complexity. asa given reeeptor may follow more than one intracellular puciway (Fishman and Cook, 1986; Stein and Sussman, 1956). The transport of internalized molecules to the Goigi cisternae has been demonstrated for transferrin receptor, and total cellular glycoproteins, resulting in biochemical reprocessing of their associated oligosacchas ides (Regoecei et a 1954: Snider and Rogers, 1985, 1986), ‘The question then arises as so whither all cell surface glyco. proteins are similarly intemalized or whether internalization ‘and oligosaccharide reprocessing includes only a selected pop- ulation, We designed experiments to elaborate on three aspects of cell surface glycoprotein movement. First, to what extent is a Golgi-mediated reprocessiny pathway utilized hy the cell to maintain steady-state levels of cell surface sialylation? Sec. ‘ond, to what degree is internalization selective? Third, can a functional correlation be drawn between those glycoproteins Which are reeyeled and those which remain resident on the cell surface? Sialic acids are added in the Golgi cisternae at a late stage of glycoprotein processing (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985). In our studies, sialic acids were used as a covalent marker by which the movement of cell surtace glyeoproteing could be traced, We used two novel techniques to assess the silylation state of the cell surface anc of individual glycoproteins on the plasma membrane: 1) to:il cell surface sialie acid was quan. 16316 50576001",6

"CAmerican Heat. Journal September, 1980, Volume 100, Number 3 Editorial ‘Smoking and coronary heart disease: what are we to believe? Carl C. Seltzer, PhD? Cambridge, Mess. ‘Two recent events have raised serious questions ‘as to what we are to believe about the conven- tional view that cigarette smoking is a cause of coronary heart disease (CHD). Interpretation of ex-smoker: ‘The first event relates to the interpretation of ex-smoker data indicating that CHD mortality rates of persons who stopped smoking are substantially lower than those of persons who continued smoking. The interpretation given to these data is that smoking cessation directly results in the reduction of risk of heart disease mortality. The most commonly cited investiga tions in support of this line of thinking are the observational studies of Doll and Hill's British doctors Hammond's American men and wom- en,’ Kahe's U.S. veterans,’ and the Framingham Study.’ Underlying this alleged CHD benefit, however, is the assumption that ex-smokers are a representative sample of smokers, except in 20 far as they have stopped smoking. But the proof of the validity of this assumption has not been forthcoming. This is a crucial point in the comparison of the CHD outcomes in the two smoking groups. For, if the assumption of repre- sentativeness is invalid and significant baseline ferences are observed between ex-smokers and samokers for relevant factors, then the possibility Recs fa ubicton 2p 1,199, Regrnt meets: Caf €. Sekar, PRD. Harvard Usiety, 11 ‘Deut Roe Combe, Mas 28, ‘Hacer Senior Ravech Ameit, Harvard ivi. exists that the mortality comparison of ex-smok- ‘ers and continuing smokers is biased. For the first time in a very large series of subjects according to race and sex, we observed the proper baseline for the determination of whether or not ex-smokers were a representative ‘sample of smokers.” This baseline involved the study of the CHD-related characteristics of ex- smokers before they stopped smoking and their ‘comparison with those of persistent smokers. The results of this study are briefly reviewed below. Using the longitudinal records from the Kaiser- Permanente multiphasic health check-ups, the study compared 25 CHD-related characteristics of ex-smokers before they stopped smoking with ‘those of persistent smokers and nonsmokers. A total of more than 25,000 subjects, white men and women, black men and women, with three or more consecutive health check-ups formed the basis of the analysis. For the criteria of the classification ofthe subject, the designated “in- dex examination,” and the list of CHD-related characteristic, the reader is referred to the publi- cation? The minimum of three or more examina- tions was used in order to insure a rigorous classification of the smoking categories. Thus, examokers (peristent quitters) were subjects who had at least one examination at which they reported both a current and past history of Cigarette smoking, followed by at least two exam- {nations in which they reported complete cessa- tion of smoking. The CHD-related characteristics fell into arbitrary categories: cardiovascular manifestations (blood pressure, hypertension, American Heart Journal 278 MASTER-SPP 002015 11063829",6

One subset ‘of nonessential genes encodes secretary proteins that hhave been named virokines (Kotwal and Moss, 19882). ‘The best studied member of this class is a 19-kDa pro: tein that can bind to the epidermal growth factor recep- torof uninfected cells and stimulate their growth (Twer: <dzik et af, 1985; Stroobant et al, 1985). Deletion of both copies of the vaccinia growth fector gene pre vents virus-induced cell proliferation and diminishes the ability of the virus to grow in animals (Buller etal, 1988a,b).

De- terminations of Vg, at time intervals in the transition from the high steady- state level induced by 2 carboltydrate-devoid casein diet, down to the low steady-state level of carbohydrate-containing basal diet, yielded two consecu tive slopes; descent from the basal diet level to the lower steady-state level following pretreatment with MC yielded one slope. Plotting these slopes against the initial Vin. values gave a typical exponential curve (or straight line if the logs of slopes are used) indicating that the rate of enzyme decay in the MC-reated animals is not greater than that exnected from normal en. zyme catabolism. A multiplicity of effector sites appears to be involved in the repressor action of different structural types; for example, repression bY MC (46.62) and by phenobarbital (23.9%) in’ combination are approxi mately additive (62.0%), rather than competitive, indicating that the two agents act at different sites.

"RR Interoffice Memorandum: ._ | Subject: Control of Tobacco Nitrates Date: october 29, 1982 and Nitrosamines To: Dr. G. R. Di Marco From: charles Green Recent papers and discussions at the 36th Tobacco Chemists' Research Conference have reemphasized the attention being given by anti-smoking forces to the role that nitrosamines may play in alleged health problems caused by tobacco product usage. Tobacco scientists have demonstrated that both volative and tobacco specific nitrosamines are related to the nitrate levels in the tobacco. In-house studies have shown that the main sources of nitrates in our products are burley tobacco, burley stems, G7 and G7A tobaccos. We have developed no procedures to control either nitrates or nitrosamine levels in our products. Our major competitor has patented several chemical and microbiological procedures for removal of nitrates from various tobacco materials. It would be prudent for our R&D organization to develop procedures for control of tobacco nitrates and nitrosamines. Being prepared to implement this type of tobacco processing may prevent us from facing future problems on a “crisis” basi (ashe Charidf Green Jone -xe: Re E, Morse WA, Rodgman 4. E.

"Acute Lower Respiratory Iliness in Childhood as a Predictor of Lung Function and Chronic Respiratory Symptoms? DIANE R. GOLD, IRA 8. TAGER, SCOTT T. WEISS, TOR D. TOSTESON, and FRANK E. SPEIZEA Inteduction Acute lower respiratory illness (LRD in ‘arly childhood has been proposed as a tisk factor, independent ofthe effet of cigarete smoke, for lower level and slow- er growth of lung function ater chilé- hood and for faster decline of lung func tion in adulthood (1,2). Because wheeze {soften a manifestation of an acute LRI inchildhood whether or nota child has asthma, separation of the effects of asth- in and othe: aa respiratory ness (Gnfectons) on level and growth of lung function in children is complicated. Ashe ‘ma or bronchial responsiveness may al- terlevel and change in level of lung func- tion or predispose to increased severity Of LRI, and may account fo the aioci- ation of LRI with alterations in lung function development. Severe infection {in early childhood may, on the othet hand, alter the course of asthma or pre- dispose towards bronchial sponsvenest and its subsequent effects on lung function. ‘As art ofa longitudinal, population- based study of ealylfe risk predictors for chronic obstructive ling disease in ‘dul life, the relationship berween lung function and several measures of acute LRI in childhood was invexigated. The results suggest that in the population studied, only the more severe acute LRI, particularly those requiring hospitaliza: tion, may be associated independently with subsequent lover level and slower srowth of lung function in children Metnods The dels ofthe initial selection and seeea- {ngof the population have been pubsed pre: iouly (3-5.

In comparison to standard ‘microfluorometric methods, similar y-ray dose-response relationships were obtained with less than 1% of the cell material when the dot hybridization assay was used. When a highly repetitive, long interspersed DNA element of the rat genome is used as a hybridization probe, as few as 10 cells of rat tissue or rat cell, culture cells per sample with approx. $0 ng of DNA were sufficient to detect single-strand breaks and protein crosslinks in the DNA of rat hepatocytes and cells of the nasal epithelium after in vitro ‘yirradiation. Since highly repetitive DNA elements are available from nearly all higher eukaryotes, this alterative approach of detecting DNA in alkaline elution analysis is generally proposed for tissues which yield only low amounts of cell material and /or which are difficult to label by radioactive DNA precursors. ‘The alkaline elution analysis technique intro- duced by Kohn and Evi in 1973 is widely used in genetic toxicology to determine chemical-or radi- ation-induced DNA damage after in vitro or in vivo exposure to genotoxic substances.

"qxn 7s TOT ROLE OF DNA SYNTHESIS IN SECRETION OF IMMUNOGLOBULIN FROM MURINE B CELLS STIMULATED BY T CELL DERIVED LYMNPHOKINES' LEIGH G. SIMPSON ax PETER C. ISAKSON From the Department of Pharmacology, University of Virgiula School of Medicine. Charlottesvile, VA 22908 We have investigated whether cell division is re- quired for induction of Ig secretion from three types 4b cells, which represent distinct activation States: normal splenic B cells, anti-lgtreated B ells, and a monoclonal murine B cell tumor, BCL1. Polyclonal Ig secretion was stimulated in vitro by 1PSor by lymphokines produced by EL-4 cells (EL 4N), which includes B cell growth factor 11 (BCGF {}, LPS and F1-4 SN were mitogenic for all three cell ‘pulations and stimulated substantial IgM secre- {ion from both B cells and anti-lg blasts. Aphidi- colin, a reversible inhibitor of DNA synthesis, abol- {shed IgM secretion from B cells and antitg blasts induced by either mitogen, indicating that Ig-secret- ing cells in these cultures are part of a cycling population. BCL, tumor cells respond to BCGF It {but not to interleukin 2 or B cell stimulatory factor 1) with IgM secretion and cell division, allowing a direct assessment of the influence of BCGF Il-stim- ulated cell division on secretion of IgM. Secretion by these cells during the first 24 hr of culture was not substantially affected by aphidicolin, but secre- tion at 48 or 72 hr was markedly inhibited. Culture of BCL, cells for 48 hr with aphidicolin alone had no effect on cell viability or on subsequent respon- siveness if the drug was removed, eliminating non- specific toxicity as an explanation of the drug's effect. Addition of aphidicolin during the last 24 hr of culture to either normal B cells or BCL, cells was much less effective at inhibiting IgM ‘secretion. ‘These results indicate that the cells that secrete IgM in response to BCGF Il also synthesize DNA when exposed to this factor. Thus, induction of high-rate Ig secretion from murine B’cells by some stimuli, including BCGF 11, may require at least one round of cell division, During the course of an immune response in vivo, B. cells both proliferate and secrete immunoglobulin (Ig) (1). tail the dependence of Ig secretion upon cell division is tincertain. Initiation of cell division does not in itself activate Ig secretion, since some stimull are capable of Inducing resting B cells to divide without secreting Ig (2. 4.

Indeed, amplified sequences [resent in a number of rnor cells and transformed cel lines ‘often include proviously characterized proto-oncogenes or re- lated genes (George, 1984). These data suggest that the plication and consequent overexpression of particular genes may play a central role in some processes of transformation ‘We are exploring the functional significance of amplified DNA sequences located on DMs in a spontaneously trans: formed mouse cell ine.

Here we show that the Rad? and Rad proteins inceract with purified factor bin vitro. Rad2 (a single-stranded DNA endonuclease) specifically interacts with the TIL subunit of factor b, and we have mapped a limited region of the Rad2 polypeptide which is sufcient for this interaction. Rad? also interacts directly with SsI2 protein (a putative DNA helicase). The binding of Rad2 and Radé proteins to factor b may define intermediates in the assembly of the nucleotide excision repair repairosome. Furthermore, the loading of factor b (or such intermediates) onto promoters daring transeription initiation provides a mechanism for the preferential targeting of repair proteins to actively transcribing genes. The processes of DNA transcription and DNA repair appear tobe conserved between yeast and human species, and several lines ofevigence indicate that these processes ar aso closely interrelated (7, 32), In mammalian cells, the initiation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoters requires the general transcription factors TFIIB, TFIID, TFUIE, TFIE, ‘TEU, and TFUL, together with RNA polymerase I, to form 8 printiation complex (9). ‘The transition to an elongation complex appears to involve phosphorylation of the carboxy: terminal domain of RNA polymerase Ml and a candidate kinase activity has been identified in purified fractions of ‘TRUITT (31). series of equivalent general transcription factors hhave been purified from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 10 particular, the yeast counterpart of TFIIH, factor b, also has Associated protein kinase and a DNA-dependent ATPase activity (11,12) Purified factor b consists of five subunits of 85, 95, 55,50, and 38 kDa (12, 49).

Studies with conditional lethal rad} (20) and ssl2 ‘mutants have demonstrated the absolute requis wild-type alleles in basal transcription. Collectively, these observations have led to the suggestion that Rad3 and SsI2 (and Ssi1 and 01) may function solely as transcription proteins which control the expression of DNA repair proteins but play no direct role in NER (see reference 15 for a review). Alternatively, Rad3 and SsI? may participate directly in both NER and basal transcription, in which case their functions in these two processes could be independent and unrelated or closely coupled. The latter possiblity could help explain the observation that transcriptionally active re gions are repaired more rapidly than the overall genome (7, 22). “Many ofthe yeast and human NER protcins are conserved ‘The human homologs of the RADI, RAD2, RAD3, RADJ.

Time alone will tell how effective any wholesale distributor has been in counteracting this blow to the business and the way it was traditionally conducted. It will not, however, take long to assess the impact on the fabric of a long-standing supplier to wholesaler relationship. We think & is worthwhile to give you our sense of what wholesale distributors are saying. In an industry whose products are attacked at every mum, munual tust and concomitant business suppor are essential elements of survival. Unilateral action by any channel participant has the potential to upset the delicate balance in today’s cigarette market Philip Morris’ treatment of its wholesale customers exhibits a callous disregard for the ‘business realities faced by long-time parmers. You have sent a message which can only be interpreted by our members and your competitors as lacking any particular commitment to the future of candy and tobacco wholesalers. Philip Morris has changed the very nature of cigarette marketing and distribution in this country. Specifically, your actions have: + Interfered with wholesalers’ ability to maintain a traditional business relationship with the retail accounts by directly contacting those accounts for the purpose of trying to influence their pricing decisions while limiting the ability of distributors to independently price their product; + Disregarded the current economic realities surrounding the distribution of cigsretes and the disastrous impact your actions have had, and will continve to ‘exercise, on the ability of candy and tobacco distributors to survive, let alone eam apmfit + Crippled the essentials of trast, respect and mutual support necessary’ to maintain 2 jointly beneficial distribution parmership in today’s environment; + Fostered overt efforts on the part of PM field sales representatives to shift diswibution away from candy aud weacco wholesalers in favor of alternative panicipants. Over the long run, these factors may combine to work against Philip Moris’ plans to increase market share al al! costs. Positive relationships built up between Philip Morris and the distibution community over the yoars are damaged. We have been listening w your customers, and what we hear is not encouraging. AWMA intends to do what it can to support wholesale distributors as they adapt to new business sealities by helping them 10 competitively and profitably serve their retail accounts.

"December 20, 1994 To All Field Sales Personnel SUBJECT: 1995 Personal Selling Programs ‘Our mission in 1995 is to focus on consumers. The ultimate measure of all our activities is the end result of whether consumers like and smoke our products. We need to make our products as visible, accessible and attractive to adult smokers as possible. Our Personal Selling Programs for 1995 offer us the opportunity to bring our messages to the consumer via quality one-on-one conversations with adult competitive smokers. Concentrating our efforts on one consumer at a time is a powerful tool in helping to achieve our company’s share and earnings objectives. Personal Selling Programs have two primary objectives: (1) Convert competitive smokers and (2) secure names via our name generation business reply cards. Personal Selling must be more than just a trial proposition. That is why we are providing the comprehensive tools to convince people to convert to our brands not just try them. Your efforts should reflect that objective. Emphasis for 1995 should focus on CAMEL, SELECT and DORAL. These brands will support your initial Personal Selling efforts with aggressive competitive conversion follow-up programs throughout 1995. SALEM may also be used where a menthol alternative is necessary. Other niche brands such as NOW and MORE may be used on an exception basis where the primary opportunity is not CAMEL, SELECT or DORAL. * The enclosed Personal Selling Kit is designed to provide you with the tools you need to insure the success of your Personal Selling. Carefully review each component. Make sure you understand our objectives and commitment to reach competitive smokers via Personal Selling in 1995. | ask for your commitment to focus on consumers and to take ‘every opportunity to talk to and convince competitive smokers to convert to our brands.

"INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM AUGUST 31, 1993 TO: HRRC FROM: FRED BEST SUBJECT: CAMEL Light casing ingredient optimization screening study. Request for approval to use higher than normal burley casing levels for sensory evaluation. A. Background - The Flavor Division would like to know the optimum levels of HFCS (high fructose corn syrup), cocoa and licorice to use in burley casing to obtain reduced harshness and more smoothness while maintaining or enhancing tobacco taste. In other words provide a more acceptable cigarette to the franchise. Doubts have been raised recently as to the need for licorice and cocoa in casing. Also, although HFCS is being tested on many products because it provides economic advantages, optimum use levels have not been determined. This current proposal is a screening study with 4 parts (high, medium and low levels of all 3 ingredients and a CAMEL Light control) to determine if sensory panels can distinguish between different casing levels. If they can, a large casing optimization study will be conducted. B. Human Participants - are needed because smoker preference is the only valid method of evaluation. €. Scientific Affairs Review - All 3 ingredients are commonly used in current casings at lower levels. Scientific Affairs xequested that we get Ames testing on the product with the highest levels of casing ingredients. This was done and no difference was found between the test product with high casing levels and a CAMEL Light control (see Attachment 1 for AMES report). Scientific Affairs has cleared these products for sensory testing pending HRRC approval. A copy of the Scientific Affairs recommendation is attached (see attachment 2). D. Product Description - Three test products made in CAMEL Light configuration and a CAMEL Light control will be used. Since endogenous sugar levels in flue-cured and Turkish tobaccos vary significantly and make sugar additions to final blend difficult to measure, this study is designed to evaluate levels applied to the burley prior to final blending. sugar additions to final blend were calculated. Since there is no endogenous cocoa or licorice in tobacco, measured levels on final blend were considered addition’ levels.

Yet, no matter what Congress does, the FCC's tentative recommendation Is certain to ire a national debate that is unlikely to coo! down in a hurry. For the companion \ auestion raised is whether, barring com- ulsion, the broadcasting industry should Danish or curtail eigarette commercials on ‘8 voluntary basis.

As long as cigarettes are a¢- cepted as safe enough to sell, the ad- vertising of competitive brands, with- in the limits of truth and decency, should not be restricted. Congress isn’t likely to permit the FCC to carry out its threat, which would amount to bureaucratic sup- pression. Pethaps the agency realizes that; but the fact that such an edict is comtemplated seems to reflect the distorted self-image of power this federal commission has assumed and apparently seeks to exercise.

We believe that Lorillard has met the actual requirements ofthe trademark license and gone beyond, in order to try to assuage Harley's concerns, Nevertheless, we believe that regardless of the specific requirements of the contract, we are desirous of having a relationship where Harley is satisfied. We would therefore welcome any suggestions you might have for what further might be done to satisfy Harley. ‘We believe that the Loews Corporation annual report and the Loews Corporation 10K provide sufficient separate information regarding Lorillard to satisfy the requirements of Section 17. In addition we have provided access to your accountants to Lorillard's books for your further assurance and we have provided a Lorillard, Inc. guarantee of Lorillard Tobacco Company's ‘obligations to obviate any concems you may have arising out of the Lorillard, Inc/Tobacco reorganization By law, the Loews Corporation annual report and/or the 10K, among other SEC reporting, would require the reporting of any materially adverse change in the financial condition of Lorillard. Furthermore, Lorillard's accounting firm, Deloitte Touche would not certify these reports as it has, ifthe separate Lorillard subsidiary had suffered a materially adverse change. Consequently, we believe that Section 17 has been satisfied. We do not understand your comments in the second paragraph. ""Assets equal to equity” ‘means the absence of liabilities which does not apply to Lorillar's situation. Lorillard's consistent practice over the years has been to declare or defer dividends depending upon the balance sheet. ‘Any act which caused a material adverse change would thereby cause Harley Davidson to be notified, ‘Since Lorillard first entered into this license with Harley Davidson, the tobacco companies gece9zh6",0

Changes in the distribution of histologic types over the past two decades in the United States. as well as high rates of lung cancer in certain subpopula tions. require explans jon. While cigarette smoking and specific occu- pational exposures are firmly established as important risk factors for lung cancer. recent work provides evidence that other factors may play a role either as independent risk factors or as modifiers of the eifect of smoking. This paper reviews the epidemiology of lung cancer. with an emphasis on developments in the past decade. 1993 Wiley-Liss. tne Key Wort factors INTRODUCTION ‘The Magnitude of the Problem ‘The United States is currently in the sixth decade of an epidemic of lang cancer. Lung cancer isthe leading cause of cancer mortality in bath sexes, acouatin fn estimated 146.000 deaths in the United States in 1992. of 34% of cancer deaths in males and 224 in femaies (l]. The American Cancer Society projects «hat 168,000 new cases will be diagnosed in 1992, ace counting for 18% of new cancers in males and 12% in females (I]. Between 1930 and 1987 the age-adjusted lung cancer morality rate increased from 4 to 74 cases per 100,000 in males and from 4 to 27 in females (1). During the past few years. lung cancer incidence rates in males have begun to level off. But those in females have continued to rise. It is clear from these figures that lung cancer will remain a major public health problem for decades to come. ‘While tung cancer incidence in males is approaching its peak in the United States, rates in developing coun- tries are increasing, presaging a globalization of the epidemic [2], Lung cancer is already the most common tumor worldwide 2) Differences in age-adjusted incidence rates for spe- cific histologic types of lung cancer by sex. race. and calendar time period suggest that different histologic types may have diferent etiologies. In white men in the 1993 Wiley-Liss, ine. ng neoplasms. smoking, environment tobacco smoke, radon. dit, host United States. rates of adenocarcinoma and oat cell carcinoma increased over the period 1969-1988, while therate of squamous cell carcinoma decreased. in white ‘women. all major types showed an increase (3.

"INTEROF FICE APEIOT— any No 434 py ny 6: M.D. Wallace FROM? E. H. Villegas SUBJECT: Packaping Materials DATE: April 15, 1986 Two package designs are currently under evaluation for the final SPA package. The artuork mechanicals for the first design were received fron marketing in mid-February. Que to the events outlined in the attached meno, RJR Archer cannot promise delivery of materials before June § (printed overurap will be delivered by mid-May), Marketing is scheduled to make the final package recommendation on June 2. This will not pive us adequate time to evaluate the materials on the G D packer and make modifications to the machine and/or materiel to optimize the package. In other words, we will be forced to go with what we have at the time. We realize some of the delays are e result of this being a “first time"" order. The ground work layed by the first request helped facilitate the second design materiel order which required only ten days for completion. The following steps should help with future orders **Communication with marketing before the design is requested. The overurap required for the Alpha package contains a layer of foil which makes the back ground color (in this case cream) take on @ grey tint. Some compensation has been made in correcting this effect, but perhaps @ different color would have been selected if the designers-had been ausre of the oreying effect of the foil. ‘#Artuork should not be given to the materials supplier until it is camera ready. Several changes (such as removing the uord ""box"", moving the location of the warning label, and changing the width of the tear tape line) were made by the design department (reluctantly because they consider a designer's art~ work sacred) and by marketing and the packaging group. In the future, artuork will not be accepted until the design has been corrected on the layouts by the designer. seMeetings which involve changes of or decisions about packaging materials need representation from the SPA packaging group and purchasing depertment. Because the SPA package differs from conventional packaging, this could prevent problems with machinability and materials. A meeting will be scheduled prior to the final desion request to discuss other considerations for the final package (embossed or non-embossed inner liner, color of the inner. frame, carton design) which are a marketing decision but impact the work of the packaging group.

PUBLICITY RECORD New York, New York May 23, 1955 CIGARETTES ON UP-BEAT AGAIN ‘The relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer is as ob- scure as before the big storm blew up over a year ago, according to Dr, Clarence Cook Little, chairman of the scientific advisory board of the ‘Tobacco Research Industry Commlt- tee. Since there are so many pos sible causes of cancer, it Is pos sible that no one element, such as ‘Some found in cigarettes, might ever be blamed as a positive, unfailing cause. As far as the American pub- Uc is concerned, It seems to concur because cigarette sales have partial- ly retaken the helghts they had a. couple of years ago. Like anybody who isn’t sure, but is willing to be cautious, a large segment of the population has shifted to fitertip cigarettes. In the long drive by the cigarette manufacturers to regain their position against the orlginal “moral’”-medical attack on smokin promotion of all types has played a major part. Originally only one side was heard from and the cigarette makers were in a disorganized re- treat, the public had to go alongwith ‘medical opinion. As soon as the positive voice of “maybe, but no fone really knows"" wan heard, then the public started to look’ more closely at the situation. Also, peoples"" habits are pernicious; they may oe subdued, but they are never really eradicated. Effective promo- ton brought home to people the post- tive element of doubt, positive from the viewpoint of the cigarette people, because even Dr. Little pointe out that no one knows as yet. A bit of proof for special situa tions that sometimes a quick retort can be worse than the temporary no defense at all. The cigarette people took too long @ time to make up their minds, but the element thot bas worked, based on medical facts, is “no one really knows.” ‘THE LOUISVILIE TIMES Louisville, Kentucky Mey 17, 1955 COR TI 15539",9

On average, sales at the local bars, taverns and pubs have dropped nearly 30 percent since the enactment of the ban, Ihave talked (0 literally thousands of owners and employees who have sales and income losses as high as 95 percent. Thousands of employees have had their hours cnt, and hundreds have lost their jobs because of the Joss of the smoking customers who form a majority of their customer base.

As for the ""huge influx of non-smoking customers"" who were supposed (0 flock to our establishments after the ban -- well, it never happened, We are attempting to regain our smoking clientele by introducing a bill that would allow bars and taverns, not restaurants, to permit smoking in designated areas wherein the latest air filtration systems are in use.

Thank you for your willingness to ask RTI to conduet some analyses for us of the data that ALF collected on some of the youth smoking prevention advertisements produced by Philip Morris USA’s Youth Smoking Prevention Department (PM USA YSP). Rather than asking RTT to conduct analyses at this point, would you please ask them to prepare a few cross tabulations for us? (""ve attached “shells” that should make this request quite clear and easy to meet. If you have any questions regarding these cross tabs, please give me a call. We remain very interested in receiving the raw data and weighting, along with a description of the layout of the data. Thank you, in advance, for letting me know when the data will be available. Ona related topic, we have reviewed the survey questionnaires (the version you gave us ‘on December 17, 2001 and the version that is posted on the ALF web site) for the LMTS- Mwave of tracking conducted in the fall of 2000. As you know, these are the survey instruments used to collect the data we have been requesting from ALF. We want you to ‘know that we are concemed that certain aspects of ALF’s data collection methodology may have biased the results ALF obtained on the PM USA YSP advertisements. ‘Some examples: PM USA YSP's intended audience is kids aged 10-14. ALF interviewed kids aged 12-17. Asa result, ALF missed 40% of PM USA YSP's audience. During the fall of 2000, PM USA YSP was running nine different youth smoking prevention advertisements. From ALF questionnaires, it appears that ALF asked respondents about only two of the ads we were running. In addition, ALF appears to have asked respondents about two of our ads that were not running during the fall. Asa result, ALF appears to have missed 62% of the ads (percentage based ‘on our allocations) that PM USA YSP was running during the fall of 2000. SZEZLessoz",0

"The Effects of Smoking Policy on Indoor Air Quality ' and Sick Building Syndrome in 18 Air-Conditioned Offices A. Hedge WA, Erickson ABSTRACT A study ofthe effets of smoking policy on indoor air qual- ‘iy and sick building syndrome symptoms among 3,155 workers in I8 private sector air-conditioned office buildings is described. Five smoking policies were investigated: smoking prohibited, “smoking restricted to rooms with local filtration, smoking res- tricted to rooms with no local air treatment, smoking restricted {0 rooms with separate ventilation, and smoking restricted to the open-plan cubicle workstations and enclosed offices. Levels of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, respirable particulates, formaldehyde, ultraviolet particulate mass, nicotine, air tem perature, and relative humidity were measured at eight sample sites in each building. Approximately 30 workers at each of the eight somple sites completed an exiensive questionnaire on ‘environmental conditions, sick building syndrome symptoms, {0b satisfaction, job stress, smoking history, and personal ‘details. Indoor air quality measures met the current ASHRAE {92-1989 standard. Comparison of al open-office sites between policies showed no significant differences in levels of carbon ‘monoxide, carbon dixide, formaldehyde, or respirable particu- lates. Levels of ultraviolet particulate mass and relative humid ity were significantly lower in buildings where smoking is prohibited, and ar temperature was significantly higher in these buildings, although on average this was <I°C. Among al bulld- ‘ngs, air temperature was the only physical measure hat was sig- nificantly correlated with SBS symptoms. Smoking policy had ro significant effet on sick buildin syndrome symptoms. INTRODUCTION ‘Tobacco smoking indoors has been identified asa source of ‘a number of indoor air contaminants, especially particulate ‘matter (Hodgson 1989; Van DeWiel etal. 1989) and combustion ‘products (Godish 1990). Burning tobacco releases several thou- ‘sand pollutants into theair, of which about 400 have been quan- tified (US, Surgeon General 1986). Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is an aerosol comprising vapor and particulate phases, both of which contain many organic and inorganic com pounds (Eatough etal. 1988). ETS is a combination of side- stream smoke ($8) from the burning cigarette and exhaled G. Rubin ‘mainstream smoke (MS) from the smoker (Guerin et al. 1987; Reasor 1987). The exposure of nonsmokers to second-hand stoke is termed “passive smoking!” Passive smoking has been linked toa variety of health problems, including ung cancer and ‘cardiovascular disease (OTA 1986; Samet eta. 1987). ‘Throughout the past decade, concerns have grown about the association between indoor air quality AQ) in the work: place and a variety of health complaint, including symptoms of the “sick building” syndrome. The sick building syndrome (SBS) describes a collection of nonspecific symptoms, including eye, nose, and throat irritation, mental fatigue, headaches, nausea, dizziness, and skin irritation, which seem to be linked with occupancy of certain workplaces (WHO 1983; Burge etal. 1987), SBS symptoms are experienced at work but are alleviated ‘when away from work for any period of time. SBS complaints among office workers are thought to be caused by poor IAQ, but substantial empirical evidence suggests that SBS problems arise from the combined effects of a variety of environmental and nonenvironmental risk factors (Hedge 1989; Hedge et al. 1989). ‘Tentative evidence of an association between passive smok- ing and SBS complaints in U.K. offices has been reported (Robertson et al. 1987), but this has not been systematically investigated. Indeed, SBS complaints are more frequent among smokers (Hodgson and Collopy 1989). In recent years, many ‘companies have introduced a smoking-probibited policy, but since up to 30% of workers may be smokers, implementing such 1 policy may not be the most cost-effective alternative. To balance the requirements of nonsmokers and smokers, other ‘companies have implemented spatially restrictive smoking poi- cies, which confine smoking to certain areas of the building. Such polices attempt to minimize any widespread ai pollution {rom cigarette smoking through dilution ventilation, localized filtration, or separate ventilation. ‘This paper summarizes findings from an ongoing research project investigating the effects of diferent smoking polices on IAQ and SBS complaints in air-conditioned private sector office buildings. Results for 18 office buildings using five dffer- ‘ent smoking polices ae described. ‘Alan Hedge and William A.

Recent investigations from our group into the regulation of human neutrophil (PMN) phagocytosis have led us to hypothesize that phagocytosis by PMN is primarily a recruited function at inflammatory sites (1-5). Stimulation of PMN with various inflammatory mediators markedly aug- ‘ments both Fe- and CRI-mediated ingestion (1-8) This re- cruitment of phagocytic function i reflected not only in the total numberof ingested targets but also in the percentage of PMN participating in the phagocytic process (1,2). Presum- ably, this regulation of ingestion acts to limit the damsging products of PMN activation, such as toxic oxygen metabolites and sereted lysosomal products, tothe ste of inflammation. ‘We and others have found that PMN can recruit several <istnet molecular mechanisms for phagocytosisin response to inflammatory signals, which may be regulated further by the specific opsonin (IgG, Cab, C3, and C3) and opsonin recep- tor(FeRIl, FeRIIT, CR, and CR3) engaged (1-9). In addition, ‘monocytes and macrophages employ quite different molecular rechanisms for phagocytosis from those employed by PMN, ‘even when the same opsonin or opsonin receptor is involved (1, 10), In this manner, at inflammatory sites where PMN and macrophages encounter pro-inflammatory cytokines, interfr- ‘ons, interleukins, chemotactic peptides, and components of ion isnot only augmented, but ‘the molecular mechanism involved in phagocytosis may be alteced. Asan example, we have shown recently that ingestion of IgG -opsonized targets by nonstimulated PMN is not depe dent upon protein kinase C(PKC)' activation. However, when PMN are simulated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF-2), not only is ingestion ofthe IgG-opsonized targets markedly increased, but PKC translocation is also greatly augmented over the minimal amount observed with either IgG or TNF-« alone (11). This synergism inactivation of PKC is essential for the increased ingestion by PMN exposed to TNF-a (11). The Jmportance ofthese dat tohost defense is demonstrated by the fact that PMN from patients with chronic granulomatous dis- case (CGD), which lack the ability to generate a respiratory ‘bust, s well as PMN from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which lack expression of FeRIL, fail to am- plify ingestion of gG-opsonized targesin respons to cytokine (CENF-x) stimulation (4,12).

"Subject: RR Interoffice Memorandum Invention Disclosure: Date: July 25, 1986 Friction Heat Source within a Cigarette Type Structure RE: Project Beta Gus Borschke From: D. L. Potter A. E. Westmoreland Nicotine is considered a significant source of flavor per- ception in a cigarette. It is well known that flavor and nico- tine delivery can be significantly enhanced in a non combustion cigarette type product if a heat source can be applied to the nicotine and flavor containing tobacco or compartment of the product. Devices have been disclosed in the patent literature which discuss several methods of providing a heat source without combusting the tobacco. [See (PCT) WO 86102528 (9.5.86)] In this patent, methods suggested to provide a non combusting heat include: An electric battery connected to a heating coil. A gas burner device. © Liquids which produce heat when mixed. This disclosure presents an alternate means of producing the desired heat through the force of mechanical manipulation by the user to produce friction heat. Within the shape of a cigarette rod there are several forms of friction which can be incorporated. Three of these are listed here with illustration but they are not intended to limit the scope of this disclosure. 1, Friction Induced Through Flexing a Material: In this design, a material is placed inside the rod structure that when repeatedly flexed will produce heat through the molecu- lar friction within its structure. This is much the same as a wire becoming hot when repeatedly bent back and forth to break the wire. The material may be a metal, bimetal, spe- cialized polymer plastic or other suitable material. ‘A memory should be incorporated into the design to return the rod shape to a straight form during and after flexing. This may be incorporated into the rod structure, as a separate material within the rod or as a part of the friction material, 1608 zezts",0

Unio:tu- Hately, many clinicians are not cog nizant of the extant pleiotropy of ean cerprone genes, some of which may predispose to a bizarre spectrom of ‘cancer types within a given family and which, on occasion, may involve all three germinal layers. The age st on- fet of a specific cancer may also be extremely variable in hereditary forms of eancer, although the average age at onset will be significantly ear. lier than the sporadic counterpart. ‘Most studies of cancer in children, ineluding the Oxford Survey of Child. hhood Cancer. have focused almost ex- clusively om cancers of infancy and <hildhood. They have given only lim- ited attention to.ancerin family mem bers. When hereditary factors have ‘been considered, indepth evaluation ‘of cancer inadults hae often been given little attention. Hence, those heredi tary cancer syndromes that are char. acterized by doth childhood- and adult- onset cancers have been frequently missed. However, one noteworthy ex. ception is the recent study by Birch cet al in which the health status or ‘cause of death in the mothers of 143 children with soft-tissue sarcomas ‘were thoroughly investigated, Inter estingly, six of these mothers had the Premenopausal onset of breast cancer and two of them had bilateral disease. This represented a threefold excess risk of breast cancer. We previously described an ex- tended kindred that showed a broad ‘spectrum of cancer; namely, sarcoma, breast cancer and brain tumors, lung cancer, laryngeal carcinoma, leuke- mia, and adrenocortical earcinoma, which we referred to as the SBLA ayndrome.* This disorder had been PUBLICATIONS previously discovered in four nuclear Kindreds by Li and Fraumeni” who ‘eubsequently published a prospective ‘observation of these families that cov. ered a Wyear time frame (969 through 1961)* Of interest was the fact that in 31 surviving family members, 36 additional cancers developed (the expected number was 0.6) Five of these were carcinomas of the breast, four were soft-tissue sarcomas, and seven were cancers at other anatomic sites. Eight of the patients had multi- ple primary eancers. Four eancers oc. curred at sites of prior radiatherapy (three soft-tissue sarcomas and one mesothelioma). ‘Our purpose is to describe two sib- lings who were affected by cancer: namely,  G-yearold boy with rhab- omyosarcoma, and his sister, who died at the age of 11 year with a stioblastoma.

A primer coaching anti-smoking activ- {sts how to get media coverage noted that “coverage of smoking ... has enjoyed an extraordinary run.’ ‘That same brochure, a project of the federal government and an anti-smoking group, also told anti-smoking activists how to dress during interviews, This well before the latest publicity barrage. Recently, yo probably read. claims that there is something, so compelling about cigarette advertising that it makes non-smokers turn to smok- ing, Never mind that in countries with to- tbacoo ad bans you may well find more adults and youngsters smoking than here. ‘There have been stories about fast-food restaurants. McDonald's, it seems, wants smokers 10 eat their burgers somewhere else, Never mind that smoking and non- smoking areas can accommodate all. Stories report the Food and Drug Ad- ministration may move to regulate ciga- rettes and claim manufacturers add nico- tine to cigarettes. Never mind that after ‘manufacturing, there is less nicotine in cig arettes than naturally occurs in tobacco. ‘Smokers are being singled outas the only soup of taxpayers to pay the bill for health are reform. Never mind that this would require that all notions of tax fairness be thrown out the window. ‘This paper now suggests that smokers ‘pay taxes to finance more government anti- smoking messages. Never mind that those ‘are messages that Americans young and old alike already understand and believe. ‘These are messages already reinforced con- tinvally and pervasively by the media, the government, schools and others. ‘Before asking smokers to pay more for their own harassment, consider: More in the USA are aware of health claims about smoking than can identify ‘Wash- ington; ‘nearly every American believes smoking is harmful; only 1 of 3 knows Je- sus delivered the Sermon on the Mount. ‘One state health department produced advertisements with smokers’ money that vilify cigarette manufacturers.

THE RESPONSE OF MURINE SPLENIC LYMPHOCYTES TO CONCANAVALIN A AND TO CO-STIMULATOR' RICHARD J. SANDERSON, KATHLEEN RULON, ELLY G. GROENEBOER, anp DAVID W. TALMAGE, “From the Department of Microbiology and the Webb- Waring Lung Institute, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, ‘Denver, Colorado 80882 ‘The blastogenic and mitogenic response of murine splenic lymphocytes to concanavalin A and the response of the resulting blasts to a lymphokine co-stimulator preparation was cxamined with an electronic particle counting and sizing apparatus (Coulter Counter and Channelizer). Mitogenesis, as determined by increase in cell number, correlated well with the time-integrated uptake of tritiated thymidine. It was found that co-stim- ulator was highly mitogenic to the lectin-induced blasts, and that the cells appearing in response to it were uni- formly large (co-stimulator blasts). Furthermore, the eventual increase in cell number was proportional to the co-stimulator concentration, at least for the concentra- tions, cell numbers, and incubation times examined. This, relatively simple assay that uses the Coulter Counter and Channelizer is therefore capable of substituting for serial measurements of tritiated thymidine uptake and yields additional information on the volume spectra of responding cells, as well as forming the basis for assay- ing co-stimulator activity. ‘The co-stimulator blasts were found to be capable of killing a wide variety of allogenele as well as syngeneic concanavalin A induced blasts. The level of killing in a Sehr “'Cr release assay varied between 9% (for the syn- geneic caso) and 24% of the maximum obtained by water lysis. ‘The proliferation oflymphocytes in eeponse to concanavalin ‘A (Con A) has been shown to be mediated by the release of a |ymphokine (co-stimulator) (1). Although it has been shown to ‘be nonmitogenic to resting lymphocytes (1), we wil show here that co-timulator causes a strong proliferation ina cell popt- lation previously stimulated by Con A, and that this prolifer- ating population contains cytotoxic cells. Its now that when spleen oF lymph node cells are mixed with allogeneic tumor call, membranes, or normal calls, killer cells may ar may not ‘be produced (2-10), depending presumably on the ability of the allogeneic calls to stimulate the production of co-stimalator in the responding cell population.

""This work was supported in part by National Cancer Institute Grant CA 20744 and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disoases Grant Al 02047. It seems likely then, that the proliferation of killer cells in response to elther the nonspecific stimulus of a mitogen, or to ‘the specific stimulus of an allogeneic call, requires co-stiraulator, In this paper, we have used a Coulter Counter to show the change in volume spectra and numbers of spleen or lymph node cells present in a response to Con A, and in the numbers of large cells that follow a subsequent addition of co-stimulator. Results have been correlated with tritiated thymidine uptake. It is shown that the most substantial cell proliferation is in response to co-stimulator, and is limited to the large cells in the volume spectrum. Furthermore, it appears that these large cells, which we term “co-stimulator blasts,” include populations, ‘that ae capable of rapid killing ofboth allogeneic and syngeneic “Con A blasts.” MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice.

"Moleculae Biology ofthe Celt Vol. 7, 000-000, February 1996 SCD5, a Suppressor of Clathrin Deficiency, Encodes a Novel Protein with a Late Secretory Function in Yeast Karen K. Nelson, Michelle Holmer, and Sandra K. Lemmon* Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44105-1960 Submitted June 13, 1985; Novernber 15,195 “Monitoring Editor Randy W. Schekmaa, Clathrin and its associated proteins constitute a major class of coat proteins involved in vesicle budding during membrane transport. An interesting characteristic of the yeast clathrin heavy chain gene (CHC) is that in some strains a CHI deletion is lethal, while in others it is not. Recently, our laboratory developed a screen that identified five multicopy suppressors that can rescue lethal stains of clathrin heavy chain-defcient yeast (Chc™ scd1-i) to viability. One of these suppressors, SCDS, encodes a novel protein of 872 amino acids containing two regions of repeated motifs of unknown function. Deletion of SCDS has shown that it is essential for cell growth at 30°C. scd5-A strains carrying low copy plasmids encoding C-terminal truncations of Scd5p are temperature sensitive for growth at 37°C. At the nonpermissive temperature, cells expressing a 338-amino acid deletion (Scd5p-4338) accumulate an internal pool of fully glycosylated invertase and mature a-factor, while processing and sorting of the vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y is normal. The truncation mutant also accumulates 80- to 100-nm. vesicles similar to many late sec mutants. Moreover, at 34°C, overexpression of Scd5p suppresses the temperature sensitivity of a sec2 mutant, which is blocked at a post-Golgi step of the secretory pathway. Biochemical analyses indicate that ~50% of ScdSp sedi- ments with a 100,000 x g membrane fraction and is associated as a peripheral membrane protein. Overall, these results indicate that ScdSp is involved in vesicular transport at a late stage of the secretory pathway. Furthermore, this suggests that the lethality of clathrin-deficient yeast can be rescued by modulation of vesicular transport at this late secretory step. ° INTRODUCTION The transfer of proteins along the secretory and endo- ytic pathways occurs by vesicular transport. The for- mation of transport vesicles involves the recruitment of coat proteins to the cytoplasmic face of the mem- brane to facilitate budding. In addition, such coat pro- teins can mediate the selection of vesicle cargo. A number of different types of coated vesicles have been characterized including clathrin-coated vesi- cles (Pearse and Robinson, 1990), COP-coated vesi- cles (Rothman and Orci, 1992), and COPII-coated vesicles (Barlowe et al, 1994).

In addition, they are involved in sorting of lysosomal hydrolases via mannose-6-phosphate receptors from the trans-Golgi network to a pre-lysosomal compartment (Campbell and Rome, 1983; Brown and Farquhar, 1984) and they are involved in the formation of secretion granules, eg. in hormone or neuropeptide-secreting cells (Tooze and Tooze, 1986; Burgess and Kelly, 1987). Although most early information on clathrin coat protein structure and function was derived from bio- chemical and cytological studies using animal cells in the last several years yeast has provided genetic ap- proaches to the study of the clathrin-mediated vesic- ular transport machinery.

"June 22, 1987 TO: Mr. R. J. Reagan RE: SSIT Trip - Equipment Inventory/Product Costing As part of our recent trip to SSIT's Janesville facilities, Ernie Farrier and I were able to inspect and review accounting records of the equipment described on pages 1 and 2 (attachments) « During the course of our inspection and review, it became evident that one piece of equipment (High Speed Feeder) costing $20,127.00 had not been properly billed. SSIT is currently preparing an invoice for this equipment and it will be forwarded for payment as soon as possible. An inventory of the equipment at Creedmoor has been tentatively scheduled for June 23rd. Appropriate tag numbers for each piece of equipment are being provided by the Janesville office to ensure continuity. Future purchases of equipment will be tagged accordingly, It appears that SSIT is making a concerted effort to properly maintain records on purchased equipment in compliance with the contract provisions. I also had an opportunity to discuss with Mr. Bruce Hamilton about the urgent need for accurate and consistent reporting of expenses relating to development. I believe it (reporting) is critical because the information generated will be used as part of the data base for projecting the cost of fuel sources onan ongoing basis (one billion units per month). Mr. Hamilton and I have agreed to have a follow-up discussion of this issue in Creedmoor on June 23rd. E M, Moére MMz1r Attachment . cc: wf. E.G. Farrier > a Mr. M: E.

Also moving on general news wires. NEW YORK (AP) Five major U.S. cigarette makers have united to argue that the Food and Drug Administration exceeded its authority ‘with a proposal to restrict minors’ access to tobacco products, newspapers reported today. ‘The FDA's proposed rule, issued last summer, declares that, cigarettes are a drug-delivery device, and therefore subject 0 FDA jurisdiction. The proposal would require tobacco companies to fund a $150 rillion annual advertising campaign to warn children ofthe health dangers of smoking. It also would ban cigarette sales from vending machines and impose restrictions on advertising tobacco product areas deemed accessible to minors. Ina jointly submitted response, the cigarette makers said they ‘will argue the FDA's proposal would violate U.S. law and the U.S. Constitution. The industry claims the FDA does not have federal statutory authority to regulate cigarettes. The New York Times and The Wall Street Joumal both carried reports on the challenge today. In their 2,000-word response, the companies said they will also argue that nicotine does not fit the legal definition of a drug and that its effects do not fit the legal definition of addiction. The companies Philip Morris U.S.A., RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown & Williamson, Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Liggett Group will submit their response today, the last day of the FDA rule's comment period, the newspapers said ‘An FDA spokesman dectined to comment on the tobacco companies’ response, the Journal said, Tobacco companies also filed a lawsuit against the FDA last year in an effort to block the agency's plan to regulate cigarettes. As part of the federal rule-making process, the FDA must consider the complaints and compile a record of how it responded to them before issuing a final policy. An FDA spokesman told the Times he didn't know how long that would take. AP-DS-01-02-96 0924EST Copyright (c) 1996 The Associated Press Received by NewsEDGE/LAN: 1/02/96 9:25 AM Page 3 SOLESPIDOS",9

It has nothing ‘to do with public health, in the sense of curbing contagious diseases. It ‘grows directly out of the concept of the Coddled “American, who has to be protected against himself at every ‘turn; who can't be trusted to manage his own affairs or make his own Gecisions, or provide for his own ‘welfare, or to buy a pack of clgarettes without being warned, These Blay Kill You.

Told Herb it killed me to do so, but the best example I could give him was Winston: we test ads, they come out great. We test product, and it's favorable to atleast at parity. I's performance: a landslide over the past decade, While he concedes the point that testing may not turn into performance, he's still hung up over this and firmly believes that a test cell could be constructed to test program effectiveness. We discussed it again today, along with CDC research underway on why Black youth smoke less than white, and he caught me by surprise saying he just got a note from JWJ.

"Beitrige tur Tabaforschung International Design Criteria for Ventilated Filters* by James A. Parker and Robert T. Montgomery Celanese Fibers Company, Charlotte, North Carolina, US. INTRODUCTION ‘There is great interest in the effecs of ventilation on the chemisey of cigarette smoke. Filter ventilation, using ‘porous plig wrap and perforated tipping paper, decreases ‘condensate delivery and ths i important in view of the rowing consumer preference for “low rar"" brands (less than 15 milligrams) Low condensate cigaretes increased 10 34.58% of US. sales in 1978, up by 9.6% (relative) from 1977 (1). Although several researchers have studied smoke filtration in ven slated cigaretes (2, 3 4, i was the purpose of this work to.extend these investigations to include a broad range of filter tow items and alzo several commercially used, ven- tilaced filters. The data showed that ventilation gives a basic design capability for controlling 2 number of smoke parameters MATERIALS AND METHODS ‘Two studies were performed to measure the effects of air ventilation: one based upon testing filters made from cellule acetate tows of increasing denier per filament (dpf),and a second using commercial sir-ventlated filters. Tn the first study, sx tow items were prepared in conven tional filter construction, where the degree of ventilation was varied by size and location of tipping paper perfor ations. The second study involved smoking a number of ‘commercial filers all of which incorporated some physical method for air dilation. Figure 1 shows the construction of the reference cigarette used in the first study. A series of these cigarettes was prepared on commercial equipment using a 64 mm stan- ard tobacco column, Two levels of ventilation were achieved using MalaucineM 1.5 and M3.0 laserperforated filer tip papers, where the coal atea of the holes in the M3. paper was approximately ewice the open area of the M-1.5 paper. In addition, control filters wsing non- ‘ventilated tipping were made. For each of the thre tip- ping configurations, six tow items were tested for which the pf canged from less than 1.5 to 5.0 and the total denier varied from 40,009 to $0,000. Filter size, 25.0 mm circumference and 21 mm length, was held constant. The plug wrap was Schweitzer No. 912, having a Coresta Volume 10 No. 1 December 1979 €EPL80r0sz permeability of 26,000 cm per min. Ten percent (w/w) triacetin was used asa plasticizer In the second investigation, thirteen commercial filers ‘were hand-tipped to 2 64 mm standard tobacco column. For both studies, presure drop, percent ai dilution, puff ‘count, particulate delivery, gas phate delivery of selected ‘components, and filtration efficiency were measured. Particulate matter delivery was measured by the Federal ‘Trade Commission method (5). Particulate removal ef- Ficiencies were derived according to Keith and Newsome (6). CO was measured by gas chromatography (7), and aldehydes were determined colorimetrically (8). The per- cent dilution was the unit puff dilution volume, measured by a bubble burette connected through encapsulation to the ventilating perforations [cf. (4)]. The puff-by-puff ventilation and tip pressure drop were assumed constant throughout smoking of a cigarete (4).

"January 11, 1984 To: Mr. R. M. Sanders FROM: Mr. W. F, Bultman ""RESEARCH RESULTS SUBJECT: SUMMARY OF AND PERSPECTIVE ON “SPORTS PAG! BACKGROUND: “ports Page” is a unique advertising medium developed for WINSTON by 13-30 Corporation. The medium {s essentially a series of posters covering sports related topics; a WINSTON ad appears at the bottom third of the poster. These posters are placed in wall-mounted displays in bars, delis, convenience Stores, bowling alleys and factory breakrooms ~ locations frequented by WINSTON's younger adult male target. As of July, 1983, 5,000 “Sports Page” displays were placed in these locations across 25 major metros. [NOTE: The posters are updated and changed bi-weekly.] ‘Two pieces of research were conducted to evaluate the efficiency and effect- iveness of “Sports Page”. A. A“Sports Page” Traffic Audit was conducted to determin 1) the number of people, particularly males 18-34 years old (WINSTON'Ss target), coming within an established distance of “Sports Page” displays on a daily basis and, 2) to determine the condition and readability of the “Sports Page” displays. This research was key to the contractual agreement between RJR and 13-30 Corporation, as explained in the Action Standards below. B. A “Sports Page” Awareness and Readership Study was conducted to determine Gureness of “Sports Page” among males, 18-34, awareness of WINSTON’s Sponsorship, depth of involvement with the “Sports Page” poster (e.g often read and for how long) and attitudes toward “Sports Page” (e.g. an appealing, informative and entertaining medium). how as ACTION STANDARDS: A. The “Sports Page” Traffic Audit These action standards or “guarantees” are excerpted verbatim from the contract with 13-30 Corporation. © The average audited traffic passing “Sport's Page” locations will be at Yeast 50 persons per day. Traffic must be within a distance of not more than 35 feet and must be in an unobstructed line of sight. Wall- mounted displays must be sufficiently accessible to the traffic such that reading of the articles in “Sports Page” may occur. 09s ¢900s",0
"————— EDITORIALS Molecular Dosimeters of Siioking Damage in the Lung 2073736740 Margaret R. Spitz. Mariza de Andrade, John Di Giovanni ‘Traditional epidemiologic research relied on self-reported ‘measures of “extemal exposure” in defining the association be- tween cigarette smoking and cancer risk. With elucidation of carcinogen-induced geneuic and epigenetic events, knowledge of, the molecular etiology of smoking-related cancers has expanded rapidly and has facilitated the study of tobacco carcinogenesis. ""The dose of tobacco carcinogens to which lung tissue is ex- posed is modulated by genetic polymorphisms in the enzymes responsible for activation (phase 1) and detoxification (phase fl) of tobacco carcinogens. For example, the cytochrome(s) P50 multigene superfamily of enzymes is involved in phase I oxida- tive processes that may create intermediates that are more reac- tive than the parent compounds and can be carcinogenic or mu~ tagenic. Phase TI metabolic processes generally inactivate these genotoxic compounds through conjugation that promotes cellu- lar excretion. The activated intermediates covalently bind 10 [DNA and form carcinogen-macromolecular adducts.

Lung cancer risk may thus be defined by a variety of factors, including the balance between metabolic activation and detox fication of tobacco carcinogen compounds, as well as by the efficiency of DNA repair, The net effect of these processes isthe ‘carcinogen-DNA adduct. Adducts then should bea valuable and relevant marker of biologically effective exposure over time. As ‘Wiencke etal. (1) stat, they represent an integrated measure of carcinogen exposure and metabolism, DNA repair capacity. and cell mover. ‘The report by Wiencke et al. (1) provides interesting and thought-provoking data, suggesting an inverse association be- ‘tween age at smoking initiation and aromatic DNA adduct levels, in the lung tissue of former smokers. In contrast. such a rel tionship was not evident in current smokers in whom smoking. intensity was the variable best associated with adduct level ‘These differences were attributed to masking of the age effect in current smokers by their approximately twofold higher adduct levels. The data in former smokers are in contrast with the pro- file that fits that of the genetically susceptible individual. who ‘could be expected to develop cancer at earlier ages andéor with fewer pack-years of exposure than nonsusceptibe individuals. in fact, Ryberg tal.

This is particularly important because its not clear whether the same adducts are being mea- sured in current versus former smokers. Schoket et al. (3) esi mated the apparent half-life for bulky DNA adduets in the bron- chial tissue to be {.7 years in former smokers. In the study by ‘Wiencke etal.

Genetic alterations ffom tobacco car- cinogen exposure may persist in former smokers. even in the presence of histologically normal appearing epithelium (4.51 ‘Thus, an area for more research is further elucidation of the kinetics of adduct removal. ‘The potential mechanisms associated with the observation that DNA adduct levels are higher in those patients who started smoking earlier are logical and based on knowledge of the fate of carcinogen-DNA adducts studied in human cells and tissues and in animal model systems (6,7) If DNA adduct accumulation is the mechanism for the observed age at smoking initiation effect, then it would be very important to know in which cels of, the tissue the DNA adducts have accumulated, One might not ‘expect DNA adducts to accumulate in surrogate populations of cells to the same extent as in lung tissue. ‘The authors show an excellent correlation between smoking- related aromatic DNA adducts in target (lung) tissue and blood ‘mononuclear cells. These results are consistent with the authors"" earlier work and suggest that such cells may serve as a useful surrogate forthe lung target tissue. This i an important finding. although the use of blood monocytes as a surrogate remains controversial. It can be hypothesized that DNA repair capacity and level of cytogenetic damage in the lymphocytes reflect processes occur- fing in the target organ. This hypothesis needs to be further evaluated if we are to develop quantitative risk assessment mod- cls for lung cancer. The conduct of large-scale population stud- Jes requires us to utilize readily accessible noninvasive tissues. ‘Analysis of the DNA adduct levels in blood mononuclear cells. ‘in celation to age at initiation of smoking, would have been imeresting and might contribute to a mechanistic understanding of the process.

C. 20036 Dear Harr} I am enclosing a draft version of a paper describing the problems associated with the original U. S. Testing study. Modified versions of the cigarette holder have now been sent for use with all the Puff Profile Analyzers, and the users have been notified of the problems inherent to lit smoking. Modified tables are enclosed, firstly correcting the U. S. Testing study for typographical errors in the data base, and secondly applying corrections for flow partitioning and smoke generation. AS described in the paper, the unlit volumes are essentially identical, any differences being caused by rounding errors in the programme. These tables show all of the smoking paraneters and thus expand upon the U. S. Testing report of dilution alone. The overall effect of these corrections has been to slightly increase the dilution change in going from ""tip"" to ""lip"", but we feel our previous conclusions are still valid.

By Andrew Evans, Lords Staff, PA News ‘The next Labour Government will seek to improve the health ofthe nation's poorest families by banning tobacco advertising, Opposition health spokesman Baroness Jay of Paddington pledged tonight Lady Jay, opening a Lords debate on poverty and ill health, told peers: “itis <isgracetul that the Government has not taken tougher action to curb smoking. An incoming Labour Government will ban tobacco advertising as a priority in our public health policy."" ‘There would also be a new Minister of Public Health ""to lead public health policy at the national level and to coordinate local action as well as to encourage good practice"". Labour would also “review and re-publish” the Government's 1982 Health of the Nation’ stratogy in 1998, to coincide withthe 50th anniversary of the start ofthe National Health Service. ‘The new version was likely to follow the Australian strategy, which called for action in five areas: distribution of economic resources, education, lving standards, conditions of ‘work, and social support “This approach would reflect our determination to make improved health a central goal ofall social policy,” Lady Jay declared, “We wil aim to reduce poverty and inequality through a commitment to help people move trom welfare to work: to end poverty pay by introducing a national minimum wage ‘and to improve housing conditions by the phased release of local authority capital receipts.” Lady Jey went on:""The embition is o ensue that these meesures inavicualy produce improvements in the health of our poorest families and that together they create more equity and a more inclusive socioty. “To achieve an inclusive society where everyone, not just the advantaged and affluent, has the opportunity to achieve their greatest health would indeed be a victory for socal justice, Lady Jay's pledge on tobacco advertising was later attacked by the president of the Motor Sport industry Association, Tory Lord Astor of Hever, who warned that it would have a “devastating effect"" on an industry which was a “real Bish success story” Lady Jay, daughter of former Labour Prime Minister Lord Callaghan of Cardi, had cealior spoken of a “stark health divide"" between the richest and poorest sections of society. The average life expectancy of the richest 10% was eight years longer than forthe ‘poorest 10%, and the poorest were more than twice as likely to de early. Halt of Britain's children, some four millon, were being brought up in poverty, often in single-parent househoids.

But perhaps the Government’ “single greatest falure™ was is failure to tackle the tobacco industry. “Today smoking is predominantly a habit of the poor. And conventional health ‘education will have vary lite impact on disadvantaged people who may see cigarettes as ‘an important prop in dificut ives.""

"Effect of Sidestream Smoke (Passive Smoke) on Cell Viability and Interferon Production* G, Sonnenfelé Summary Several studies have been carried out to evaluate the toxicological effects of sidestream smoke. The work carried out in out laboratory will be reviewed herein. Sidestream (passive) smoke has been generated utilizing the peristaltic purp smoking machine. This machine allows for simultaneous exposure of specimens to sidestream and mainstream smoke. The target cells used were the murine 929 fibroblast-like cell line. Exposure of these cells 10 sidestream smoke from the 2R! reference cigarette resulted in dose- dependent cytotoxicity, Use of the JRAF reduced yield cigarete also resulted in dose- dependent cytotoxicity. A lower dose of sidestream smoke from the IR4F cigarette was requited to generate 80% cytotoxicity of L929 eels than when sidestream smoke from the 2RI cigarette was used. The effects of sidestream smoke exposure on production of interferon-alpha/beta, an antiviral, amicancer, and immunoregulatory substance, was also determined. Production of interferon by 1-929 cells was inhibited severely after ‘exposure ofthe cells to non-<ytotoxie doses of sidestream smoke from the 2RI cigarette. Filtration of the smoke through activated charcoal reduced the inhibition of interferon production, In addition, aging of the smoke also resulted in reduction of the inhibition of interferon induction. Introduction Over the past several years «peristaltic pump smoking machine has been used in our laboratory to study the ability of sidestream (passive) smoke to induce various toxic effects in a cell culture system. These i vitro studies will now be reviewed in this paper “The smoke exposure system used was the peristaltic pump smoking machine especially adapted for exposure of tissue cultures (Griffith 1985; Griffith and Hancock 1985). Cultures of -929 cells,a murine fibroblast-likeline, were grown to confluency and exposed to sidestream smoke, The eytotoxic effects of the sidestream smoke generated from a 2RI unfiltered reference cigarette were determined (Sonnenfeld et al, 1985). In addition, these effects were compared withthe cytotoxic effects of sidestream smoke from the IR&F filtered, ventilated, reduced yield experimental cigarette (Sonnenfeld and Wilson 1987). “The interferon system was originally described as an antivical defense system, but may play a role in defenses against respiratory tract infections and cancer (Sonnenfeld and.

"What happens when cigarette smokers give up the habit? Do their chances of dying of pulmonary and cardiac diseases decrease? Do they lose various physical complaints? Evidence on these points is presented in this report, and the evidence indicates that those who stop have a more favorable future, and the longer they stop the better the outlook. EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTS OF GIVING UP CIGARETTE SMOKING E.Cuyler Hammond, SeD,, FAPIHA. EDENcE on the eles of ving wp smoking is more dificult to obtain than one might suppose. We must first inquire why some habitual smokers give up the habit and whether, once having stopped smoking, they are likely to re: sume the habit at a later date. In a mail survey conducted in 1958, wwe asked excigarette smokers why they hhad stopped and whether they thought ving up the habit had any effect on their health or the way they felt ‘About 60 per cent said that they had stopped because of some physical com- plaint such as cough, chest or throat complaints, loss of appetite, stomach trouble, or circulatory difficulties. Eighty- two per cent of those who ssid that they had stopped because of a physical com: plaint indicated some improvement (such as less coughing) as an apparent result of giving up the habit. Seventy: four per cent of the men said that they gained weight. Table 1 shows the reasons for giving up smoking as stated by a sample of men between the ages of 50 and 69 who filled out questionnaires in late 1959 and early 1960. All of these men 602 had a history of only cigarette smoking and had stopped less than a year prior to answering the questionnaire. About 17 per cent of them were “sick at pres: * Over half of those who were sick that they quit smoking because of some illness oF physical complaint and over three-quarters of those who were not “sick at present” gave the same sort of reasons. The most frequently stated reasons were “doctor's orders,” heart and circulatory diseases, and pul monary complaints such as cough, fu, sinus trouble, and other respiratory con- ditions. ‘Two years after enrollment in a pro- spective epidemiological study, surviving subjects were requested to fill out a second questionnaire? They were asked whether they had been hospitalized and whether they had any serious diseases Since enrolling in the study.

"Inhalati - by E, Cuyler Hammond, Se.D.* Irving J. Selikoff, M.D.** Patrick J, Lawther, M.D.‘ Both cigarette smoke and polluted urban air mn of Benzypyrene and Cancer in Man \ contain very small amounts of benzo(a)pyrene, or BaP, a substance which is carcinogenic to experimental animals if reletively large amounts are applied in certain ways such as skin painting or subcutaneous injection. This suggested the possibility that the BaP in cigarette smoke might account for the high degree of association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer; and it suggested the possibility that BaP pollution of urban air might perhaps increase the risk of lung cancer~ Wynder and Hoffman found an average of 2.5 micrograms of BaP in the smoke from 100 American cigarettes smoked mechanically. Based upon this, it would appeer that even during a 1ifetine of heavy cigarette snoking, the con centration of BaP per square centimeter of bronchial t: be spread would be extremely small as compared with th skin cancer in mice. ‘The concentration of BaP in the air of large Jesue over which it might e dose required to produce American cities is reported to vary from about 0.3 to 6.0 micrograms per 1,000 cubic meters in sumner and from 6.0 to as high as 74.0 in winter.

"AP 37046 ra - isa Smoking-Fetuses,0480 08.24 Illa Study shows fetuses metabolize cancer-causing tobacco byproduct AP Photo BX101 By ERICA NOONAN Associated Press Writer BOSTON (AP) - Researchers announced they found the first direct evidence that fetuses of women who smoke actually metabolize cancer-causing agents contained in tobacco. The study goes beyond what scientists have known for years ~ ‘that smoking by pregnant women causes babies to be bom smnaller, sicklier, at @ higher risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and - in some cases - even addicted to nicotine. The study, conducted by University of Minnesota professor Stephen S. Hecht and sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, ‘examined the first urine produced by 48 German newborns. It was presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Boston. With the same equipment used to conduct sophisticated drug tests on athletes, scientists searched for traces of the chemical NNK - nicotine-derived nitrosaminoketone - one of the strongest cancer-causing agents found in all types of tobacco products. Previous studies have shown a relationship between NNK and lung cancer in humans, as well as tumors in mice, rats and hamsters. Experiments also have shown that NNK is a ""statistically significant"" cause of tumors in the offspring of pregnant hamsters and mice given the chemical, Hecht said While researchers found no traces of NNK in newborns of non-smokers, they detected the carcinogen in 22 of 31 newborns of mothers who smoked during pregnancy The pregnant women in the two-year study smoked between 5 and 25 cigarettes per day, averaging 12 cigarettes per day. Results showed that NNK crosses the placental barrier between mother and fetus, where it is then broken down by the fetus and expelled in its urine, Hecht said Hopefully this will deliver the message one more time about how dangerous it is for pregnant women to smoke,” Hecht said Sunday, a day before he was to formally present the study to the society, which represents more than 150,000 scientists worldwide Hecht said more research is needed to determine the likelihood of the NNK leading to cancer in the newborns later in life, Because ‘most mothers who smoke during pregnancy will continue to smoke Lof2 713167-9297",9

"June 13, 1988 To: ALL. Barnett From: J. J. Gohn e606: Subject: ion Concepts The purpose of this memo is to forward a perspective on the potential tie-in of RORT and MGH/UA for the purpose of leveraging this union with impactful consumer promotions utilizing pre-recorded video cassettes. Background In December 1987, focus groups were held in Atlanta to determine how CAMEL and Mariboro smokers would react to pronotions which include pre-recorded video cassette films from Paramount Studios. This tie-in with Paramount was identical in concept to the proposed tie-in with NGH/UA, The findings of these focus groups, although qualitative, in a single market, from a smal} sample, etc., illustrated 2 major lack of interest in buying video movies even at a discount price when they can be rented so cheaply and so conveniently. — @ Perspective According to 1987 Simmons data, a high percentage of adult smokers own a VCR (38.7), however, only 18% of these VCR owners have ever bought a pre-recorded video cassette. An extremely large majority (97%) rent movies becaus - Rentals are cheap. Current movies can be rented for $2 or $3 and if they want to retain it, they can just record it on a blank tape. + Hit titles are readily available. Most only watch a movie once. - Rentals are extremely accessible. Most are rented where cigarettes are not sold but are becoming more available in supermarkets, drug stores and convenience stores.

USA Vol 89, pp. B887-8491, September 1992 Cell Bilogy Focal adhesion protein-tyrosine kinase phosphorylated in response to cell attachment to fibronectin (signal transduction extracellular matrix/integins/plymerase chain reaction) SteVEN K. HaNKs*, Minall B. CaLais, MELINDA C. HARPER, AND SHEEVAL K. PATEL Departeat of Cel Biology, Vander University School of Mediie, Nesbvle. TN 37232 Communicated by Stanley Cohen, une 1, 192 ABSTRACT A homology-based cDNA cloning approach ‘was used to identify a widely expressed protein-tyrosine kinase designated as “focal adhesion kinase” (FadK). The entire rouse FadK amino acid sequence was deduced from cDNA. clones, revealing a large (119-kDa) non-membrane-spanning protein-tyrosine kinase that lacks Sre-homology SH2 and SH3 domains. Immunostaining of BALB /e 3T3 fibroblasts revealed that FadK is concentrated in focal adhesions. FadK is phos- phorylated on tyrosine in growing cultures of BALB/c 3T3 cells but contains litte or no phosphotyrosine in cells detached by trypsinization. The tyrosine-phosphorylated state is re- sgained within minutes when the cells are replated onto fibro- nectia. Activation of FadK may be an important early step in intracelolar signal transduction pathways triggered in re- sponse to cell interactions with the extracellular matrix. ‘The metazoan proteinyrosine kinases (PTKs) make up a large segment of the eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily (1, 2)and are known for their oncogenic potential as well as their roles in regulating aspects of normal development (reviewed in refs. 3-$), PTKs are grouped into two broad structural classes on the basis of whether or not they span the plasma ‘membrane. Membrane-spanning PTKs include receptors for various peptide growth and differentiation factors such as epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, Receptor PTK activity is stimulated upon ligand binding, and subsequent receptor autophosphorylation followed by phos- phorylation of exogenous substrates is an initial event in the signal transduction pathway (reviewed in refs. Sand6). PTKs that do not span the plasma membrane (ie., members of the Sre subfamily) have also been implicated in the transduction of extracellular signals that control cell growth and differen- tiation (reviewed in refs. 7-9) Given what is known about the widespread involvement of PTKs in regulating developmental processes, we sought t0 identify and characterize PTKs, with the ultimate goal of obtaining insight into how cells respond to environmental cues that influence their growth and differentiation. In this feport, we describe a non-membrane-spanning PT identi- fied by alhomology-based DNA cloning strategy and present evidence that its activation may be part of a signal transduc~ tion pathway triggered in response to cellular interactions with components of the extracellular matrix (ECM).

The thermocyeling parameters used were as follows: annealing, 2 min at SO°C; extension. 3 min at 72°C: denatur- ation, 0.5 min at 94°C. Amplified CDNA products of ~210 base pairs were subcloned and nucleotide sequences were ‘determined for 200 inserts picked at random. Isolation of CDNA Clones Encoding Mouse FadK and North- erm Analysis of Expression. The PCR product TK3 was used as a probe to screen (10) a mouse 8.Sday embryo CDNA library (11) constructed in Agt10. To obtain clones represen: tative of the entire =4.Sckilobase (kb) transcript, it was necessary to resereen the library with probes derived from the 5” and 3"" ends of the initial eDNA isolates. Nucleotide sequences were determined, from both complementary strands, for four overlapping clones to obtain the composite sequence shown. RNA isolation and Northern hybridization were done as described (12). The blots were hybridized with a probe derived from a BamHll~Ace I fragment (nucleotides 3476— 4084) in the 3° untranslated region of the FadK cDNA. Production of Antiserum to FadK and Antibody Affinity Purification. Anti-FadK antiserum was obtained from New Zealand White rabbits immunized with a bacterially ex: pressed fusion protein consisting of the C-terminal 150 amino acid residues of mouse FadK. lying downstream of 16 vector- derived residues from the p17-7 plasmid vector (13). Ant bodies from the immune serum were affinity-purified (14) against the fusion protein blotted to Inymobilon membrane (Milipore). Immunoprecipitation of FadK, Immune-Complex Kinase Assay, and Phospho Amino Acid Analysis. BALB/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (from W. J. Pledger. Vanderbilt Univer: sity) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's me- dium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum. Cellular proteins were metabolically labeled with [/*S]methionine/ ‘cysteine by incubating the cells for 16 hr at 37°C in methio- ninesfree DMEM containing 5% complete DMEM, 4% calf serum, and Tran?S-label (1000 Ci/mmol; ICN; 1'Ci = 37 GBq) at 100 uCi/ml.

The rapid insertion of these newly generated vesicles enables the perigranulat nenbrane of the activated granule to enlarge and expand prior to fusion with the plasna menbrane and/or with the neighboring granule menbranes.

Since excess membrane in the form of folds or inclusions has riot been observed in the quiescent granule and it is known that menbrane cannot stretch beyond 2-38 of its original area (4), it is necessary to consider that new menbrane is generated during granule activation, Fusion of this newly generated menbrane with the perigranular membrane would enable the granule to expand and the perigranular menbrane to Lift from the surface of the granule matrix. By using various ultrastructural techniques, we found that: First, rapid-freezing and freeze-substitution of mast cells reveals the presence of menbeane vesicles associated with activated or secreted granules. Second, purified granules after removal of their perigranular membrane can generate membrane vesicles, And third, membrane vesicles and the fusion of these vesicles with the petigranular menbrane have been observed using a simultaneous activation, fixation, and menbrane enhancenent (SAFME) procedure, (0006-291X/85 $1.50 Coppright © 1985 by Academic Press, Inc.

"NEWS Hutchinson, Kans. . Tnerease The Tax 30 Cents Jan. 16, 1964 0518 7F Helena, Mont. Both the Governor and the mem- ‘vers hope that the legislature's budg- et session can be completed without raising taxes. Except, of course, the levies on cigarettes and alcoholic bev- erages. But those don't count be- cause in Kansas they still are sym bols of sin. ‘The News strongly opposes adding another penny a package to the tax = on cigarettes. Tt does so simply be- cause that isn’t nearly enough. ‘The tax should be advanced at least 30 and perhaps even 50 cents. ‘This proposal, fantastic although it ” INDEPENDENT-RECORD Page 20 ay at first seem, would provide sev- eral millions a year in added revenue which the state needs badly, even though it undoubtedly would bring about a sharp drop in cigarette sales. But this is not the primary reason for making this recommeéndation. The News does so as a matter of public health. If Kansas once thought it vie tal to eliminate the common drinking ‘cup and the house fly, today in the light of the Surgeon General's com- mittee report, it should do what it feasibly can to discourage the use of Aigarettes. ven. 4, 196 Government Aid in Selling Poison Everybody's talking about cigarets, but we'll lay you 10 to one that nobody ‘ever does anything about them, In foct, we might even go farther and predict thet the United States govern- ment, which has raised the question of tthe smoker poisoning himself in a multi- tude of different ways through his use of the weed, will go right along helping him in the process. For the biggest foundation to the tobacco industry is.the subsidy which the Department of Agriculture pays to ‘tobacco growers who hove skillfully man- ‘eged to keep production high in spite of restriction of supported ocreage. In other words, we undoubtedly will see the federal compaign against the tse of tobacco gother impetus while the government continues to pay formers for raising it. ‘And, at the same time everyone will debate about what should be done. Some will say thet the tobacco industry should not be allowed to advertise. Some will say that the type of advertising shuld be censored. Some will want a counter rogram to advertise the ills which result from the use of tobacco. We would give ‘dds that none of these will be adopted ‘end would not produce much in the way of results if they were, If we were serious about stopping. or reducing the use of tobacco there ore two simple steps which would be effec- tive ‘One would be to cut off the support to the tobacco grower. This could even be reversed by requiring @ license for the privilege of growing @ poison weed and charging a tax for each acre planted, Then the government could double its tox on the finished product, @ tax which already is the biggest factor in the re- toil price. Few are going to quit smoking because they are ofraid of lung cancer or any other disease, They know that it is al- ways the other fellow who is stricken. Few will quit smoking becouse it is forbidden or even because the product is made difficult to acquire. But many will quit if it is mode more expensive. ¥ GPTTSTSOOT",9
"To: Rec'd, MAYS 182 ic Inter-office Memorandum Tobacco Cost Reduction by Modification Date: May 4, 1982 of G-13 Blends Dr. J. P. Dickerson From: D. P. Johnson A number of proposals have been made in previous memoranda for reducing RJR tobacco costs without sacrificing product quality. ‘Among these is a proposal to reduce the burley content of our blends, since burley is the most expensive primary tobacco used. To help accomplish this, I recommend that consideration be given to changing the ratio of flue-cured to burley in our G-13 blends. At present, most of these blends contain three parts burley to one part flue-cured. Since all of our cigarette blends contain 12% or more G-13, this means that a minimum of about 37% of our burley is puffed. Although puffed burley retains much of its . normal smoking character, it nevertheless is altered, and its impact is reduced. This, coupled with the fact that about 40% of our burley also is denicotinized, probably demands a higher percentage of burley in our blends to achieve the desired flavor level. Two factors contributed to the initial decision to adopt a high burley blend for puffing. First, puffing imparts a significantly lighter color to tobacco, and puffed flue-cured pecially conspicuous in the cigarette filler. Thus, burley, with its naturally dark color, was chosen, and initially it was the only type puffed. Secondly, flue-cured tobacco retains considerably higher levels of residual freon than cased burley, and additional information was needed on the rate of dissipation of freon and its fate during the burning process. ‘This question has since been answered, and concern for both factors has abated. There- fore, if the burley to flue-cured ratio in the G-13 blends could be changed to a high level of flue-cured and a low level of burley, perhaps a reduction in total burley could be made and an overall cost reduction realized. Recently, a high flue-cured/low burley G-13 blend has been adopted for the ultra low tar brands because of the high levels of G-13 in these products. However, these brands represent a relatively small percentage of our total production. A secondary, but very important, benefit to be gained by reversing the tobacco ratio is improved product uniformity. G-13 is com- bined with the remainder of the blend in the top dressing drum, and in spite of Manufacturing's best efforts, uniform blending is not always achieved.

We had a letter from Walter Essman and have written him (see attach- ed letters), This work seems to be underway. We have set things up with Richard Levy and will start in January. There is no room for live animal air shipping until after January 7, 1974 so the schedule will start on January 18th. We must get things moving with the group at Oak Ridge. The smoking experiment is underway with the IAI and IRI cigarettes in DBA/2 and C3H/f male and female mice. They seem to tolerate 5 cigarettes in the morning and repeat in the afternoon. No deaths have occurred so we will go on up and see what it takes to kill them and then back off on the Second round. I will leave here on December 27th and return January 14th. We hope to complete a report bringing you up-to-date before I leave. This will also fulfill the contract’ request for a report before the end of @ contract period (January 31, 1974 for the smell contract). Mr. Ruwet still has no notice of continuation of this contract so we can continue to spend at the same rate. Will you, please, send along the necessary papers?

"Suvpar, JUNE 5, 1994 onuaatyunnicis Cd, ee Ps Chet ehingte fost eee Commentary and Opinion UTLOOK The Marlboro Math Forget the Cigarette Tax Hike; Smokers Already Pay Their Share By Jane Gravelle and Dennis Zimmerman, everything about President Clinton's health care reform package, with one notable exception. A ‘vast majority favors the proposed 75-cent tax on a pack of cigarettes. Were one to be cynical, such support ‘ight be explained by the fact that only about a quarter of adult Americans smoke, so that the majority of us anticipate receiving health care paid for by others. For- tunately, a more charitable—and conventional—expla- nation exists: that the 25 percent of American adults ‘who smoke impose great costs on nonsmokers, thus a 75-cent tax increase would compensate nonsmokers for these social, or “external,” costs. If true, nonsmok- ers can rest easy knowing that imposition of a cigarette tax isnot only in their financial best interest, but is also abundantly fair. But is it, in fact, fair? Let’s take a look at the evi- dence. The financial costs smokers impose on non- ‘smokers have been extensively examined in a 1991 study funded by the Rand Corp. Updating the study's mid-range estimate to 1995 price levels yields a net external cost of smoking of $3 cents per pack. Since ccurrent federal, state and local taxes are 50 cents per ‘Jane Gravelle and Dennis Zimmerman are economists ‘atthe Cor Research Service of the Library of Congress. The views expressed are their own. A ‘merican taxpayers seem to disagree on almost pack or more on average, the RAND-sponsored study suggests that smokers are already paying more than their way. ‘These modest spillover costs may seem inexplicable in light ofthe assertions of organizations that advocate tax- es far larger than 75 cents per pack. But the Rand study ‘makes some critical distinctions many of those organiza- tions don't aclnowledge. For instance, the Rand study identifies ‘al of the costs and benefits that smokers im- ‘pose on others—and excludes the costs smokers pay for themselves. Thus, the study includes as external costs only that portion of smokers’ excess medical expendi- tures (49 cents per pack) and sick leave costs (1 cent per pack) not paid by smokers, the higher life and fire insur ‘ance premiums due to smoking (7 and 3 cents per pack respectively) and the lost tax revenve smokers would ‘have paid to retirement and health programs had they not died prematurely (12 cents per pack). ‘Additionally, the authors of the Rand study include the offsetting savings that smokers’ premature death pro- vides to nonsmokers—an obvious but often overlooked factor. After al, the alternative to death from a smoking- related illness is not immortality and perfect health—itis later death, and perhaps from a more costly illness (net- ted out in the 49 cents per pack above) or larger nursing home casts (a 6 cent offset per pack).

Two types of beating, venillaiing and aircon <Altiontng (HVAC) systems were examined: constant air tolume (CAV) and variable air volume (VAY). Two types of smoking policy were examined: unrestricted smoking land smoking restricted 10 designated lounges. Toe four ‘buildings represented allcombinations ofthese four vari- ‘ables. One floor of each building was investigated, wi measurements conducted during tbe summer when HVAC tems were not in economizer mode, bey used ‘minimal outcide air, Inspections of tbe HVAC systems Indicated that ther operation and maintenance were acceptable, Ventilation wae measured by standard pro- Cadre based on vlocly traverses. ‘During the ets, al oureystems provided ventilation rates exentally conforming 10 ASHRAE Standard 62- 1989. ndicatorsofairqualily avd environmental bac co smoke (ETS) were determined in outside and returvairsireanss and offices 1AQ indicators included respirable suspended particles (RSP), formaldehyde, tolaile organic compounds (VOC), carbon dioxide (C02) and carbon monaxide (CO). ETS indicators fn- ‘duded ulravolet particulate maiter(UVPM), fluorescent particulate maiter(FPM) and nicotine. Smoking activity twat assessed by collecting and counting cigarette buts, Results show that: (@) smoking activity bad a neglt- _gible efect on contaminant levels in buildings were Smoking was unrestricted; (b) resriciing smoking 10 lounges eliminated ronsmoker exposure to ETS by preventing smoke from dispersing fo adjacent areas; and (with be HVAC systems adequately designed, operated fn aceordasice with the current ASHRAE Standard and properly maintained, all indicators were well within ‘opplicable standards, regardless ofthe smoking policy.

Ths ebservation, plus the tase, Supra fs Tei Thames taboo Pincton Unies, Pine, cancers in a 2-6emonth time period, demonstrates that the p53 gene is indeed a tumor suppressor gene (4). During tumorigenesis, selective pressures on tumor suppressor genes result in mutant alleles that have a lass of function ‘These mutant alleles are recessive tothe wildiy ate characterized by the absence ofa particular phenotype. The p53 mutant alleles from human cancers, however, ap- pear to have been selected (86% of the time) to comain Inissense mutations that produce altered or faulty proteins that accumulate tohigh levels in the cancer celle. tndeed, 92% of 1447 p53 mutations sequenced from h ‘cerous tissue are localized in aretrcted region {between codons 120 and 290, of 393 codons), suggesting selection for an altered p53 protein product with specific phenotypic properties (6).

"""FTC Plans Product-Eindorsement Guides, With Organizations’ Plugs the Main Target ya Was Seater Joona Stag Reporter WASHINGTON ~ The Federal Trade Com- mission proposed to adopt six guides for the Use of product endorsements and testimonials in advertisements ‘The purpore would be to avold possible de- ception in sich ads, PTC offlelals said. As pro- posed, the guides appear to be almed more at endorsements by organizations, such as sports| leagues and trade groups, than by individuals, such an athletes and movie stars. One proposed gulde, for example, specties| that organizations ""may be requlted to meet a more stringent standard of truthfulness” be- [cause their endorsements “may tend to imply ‘that deftnite standards” have been met by & product.

The com> fan advertiser disclose if compensation were ald to a trade group in return for that group's endorsement of a product. But under the same [gulde, an advertiser wouldn't have to disclose ‘hata film star was pald to endorse a product. ‘Two other guides state that endorsers who! fare represented as experts should in fact have expertise conceming the product involved and that endorsements by such authorities should bbe based on thelr experience instead of only on financial compensation. For example, the FTC last year tasued a [complaint challenging advertising claims. by JAmstar Corp. that its Domino and Spreckles [sugar were endoreed ax the “ottical migar” of the National Football League and major league baseball because of superior nutritional value The ‘commission. charged the professional sports leagues endorsed the products primarily plaints pending ‘A fith proposed FTC pulde states that tet monials about “typical consumer's"" exper fence with a product should also reflect the ay forage experience of consumers with the prod uct.

Although Clinton admitted that the chances of his cigarette Leaf Bulletin 99-22 tax hike passing Congress were slim to none, Senate Minority Leader ‘Tom Daschle (D-SD) said a cigarette tax albeit a smaller one is still salvageable. “Tthink the president acknowledged that maybe 55 cents the Republicans may not be able to accept, but there's along way from one cent to 58 cents. And that is still on the table and very much alive,” Daschle said (TW99-13). Engle Ruling: On October 20% Florida's Third District Court of Appeals reversed its slo stance ve damane or Phase To. he Ente tial at g sum. Industry attorneys vigorously objected telling the panel that a single: award would cause an “enormous amount of irreparable harm tothe industry.” Analysts expressed surprise. The Negatives: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst David Adelman described the decision as “the worst outcome of the appeal; {and it] was the least likely outcome.” Salomon Smith Bamey analyst Martin Feldman believes that the ruling will “substantially” increase litigation risks for the industry. “It's hard to identify a simple series of events that would lead toan industry victory,” said Feldman. “You are looking at a jury, that has already decided against the industry, being asked ‘how much?” That prospect is tough.” Feldman also doubted the likelihood of the Engle case being stripped of its class certification anytime soon. The Positives: Goldman Sachs analyst Mare Cohen said that the “ruling was narrow in scope and leaves open opportunity for the industry to pursue a separate appeal of the constitutionality of the Engle court's treatment of punitive damages on substantive merits...” Legal sources, he added, “strongly believe that the Engle court is going against FL statute and both US. Supreme Court and FL state court case precedent ...” Sanford Bernstein analyst Bill Pecoriello suggested that if the appeals court and the Florida Supreme Court do not significantly reduce a large punitive damage award and/or decertify the class, that the US. Supreme Court will ultimately reject any punitive damage verdict. “This,” wrote Pecoriello, “will mark the death of all tobacco class actions.” Stock Fallout: Tobacco stocks sank dramatically on the news. ber 20th, both Philip Morris Cos. (PI Ri Reynol 12% each on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and PM shares eventually hit a four-year low, representing the largest fallin at least 19 years. Adelman said there is “fatigue” and “frustration” among investors regarding the seemingly endless cloud of litigation. However, Cohen called tobacco, stock price declines “an unwarranted reaction to the developments in the Engle case. ... we continue to believe that this case will be resolved far more favorably than market trading implies.” A “far more positive landscape” is on the horizon than the one investors currently envision. Further, he said his contacts believe no tobacco company bond will be required before an appeal (TW99-43, Dow Jones 10/21, Bloomberg News 10/21, WS} 10/21, Goldman Sachs 10/21). Other Litigation: The Sunday Business reported that tobacco companies in the United Kingdom may be up against a new wave of litigat ime from i The paper said it learned that an official inquiry conducted by the Commons Health Select Committee may recommend filing suit if sufficient evidence of company wrongdoing is brought to light.

In a positive turnaround, WWE is now able to accomodate display of our creative -- (they had thought the amaller venue this year would prevent this feasibility). Enlarged posters (approx 2'x4') of our creative will be placed on easels -- on each end of the display area. We forwarded mounted posters we had available from a previous event for use in this venue -- 1 each of Comic BookWoman and Eggshell. Additionally, WWE will be distributing 8 1/2"" x 11"" flyers for us with the Comic Book Woman creative. They decided not to move forward with the initial flyers that had the listing of the play-by-plays on the back. Instead, the ""Play by Play"" list I emailed to you on Wednesday will be enlarged to poster size -24""x 36"" and be displayed instead. They will use our traditional buttoutnow.com logo treatment for this poster, instead of the special treatment I had requested if the flyer had remained at ite current size. our tv spot ""Roonmates"" will air on-screen for each play by play Participants prior to their play by play commencing. WWE hag also said that if we would like to provide them with some branded YSPP tshirts, the people manning the play by play attraction would be happy to distribute them to the kids. If you're interested, we can decide if we'd like to give 25 or 50 for each session--to the first 25 or 50 kids per session (3 sessions a day]. We have plenty of tshirts available for this, if you'd like to take advantage of this. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed. Thank you. carolyn Fantasy ayby Payrendtion pot 81877987",2

Professor Soila is of the firm opinion that the incidence of bronchial carcinoma in Finland, attributed to cigarette smoking, has been grossly over-emphasised. He made the claims that a) Smokers of less than 15 cigarettes a day do not attain the threshold of risk. b) The risk of lung cancer for smokers (overall?) was not 1 in 9, but only 1 in 200. Professor Soila drew our attention to the comprehensive nature of the biomedical statistics maintained in all Scandanavian countries, including Finland, and their ready accessibility to bona~fide researchers. He was, apparently, looking for support for a prospective survey of a section of the population and for a comparison between the various Nordic Countries - Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland (and Iceland? - he mentioned five countries). He was not aware of the recent Swedish 10-year follow up survey of 50,000 people by Cederléf, Friberg, Hrubec and Lorich of the Karolinska Institute.",0

Security is a necessary discipline at all times in business operations but is especially critical to the Company at this time due to the vast number and significance of many projects in which we are currently involved--and especially in view of recent ""leaks"" of new brand and promotional/ advertising programs under development. Disclosure of such information can be of substantial advantage to our competitors and works to undermine the hard work and dedication which all of us_try to bring to our contribution to Company growth and profits. Accordingly, effective immediately, we're adopting the following program to assure that information remains confidential to those parties directly involved with any sensitive Company matter: I. Our Own Attitudes - Any program of this nature requires each of us to become more concerned about the harm that disclosure of sensitive information can cause.

House of Representatives 2162 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Dear Congressman Hall: Last December, I wrote to you about the tobacco industry's new initiatives to discourage youth smoking. Since then, we have had a number of encouraging developments. I would like to bring you up to date on some of the results — especially in Ohio — since we launched our programs. As part of our efforts, we supported the recently-enacted legislation now in effect in Ohio requiring supervision of cigarette vending machines. We backed this bill, and are delighted that it has now taken effect. Our retail program, ""It's the Law,"" helps retailers observe state minimum sales age law by providing store signs, stickers, informational brochures and lapel buttons. There are currently more than 100 cosponsoring retail organizations nationally, including the Ohio Association of Tobacco & Candy Distributors, the Ohio Council of Retail Merchants and the Ohio Grocers Association. The co-sponsors are assisting us in the distribution of ""It’s The Law” materials free of charge to retail outlets. To date, over one million pieces of the program's materials have been distributed across the country. If you are aware of any retailers that would like the materials, we would be happy to provide them without charge. ‘The industry's support of the new Ohio law and ""It’s the Law” are part of a broad- based series of initiatives to discourage youth smoking and address recent concerns about cigarette marketing. In addition to those efforts outlined above, the tobacco industry has also placed sharp new limitations on the distribution of product samples and premiums, requires that billboard advertisements for cigarettes be located away from areas near schools and playgrounds and has implemented other strong new industry guidelines. And, through a nationally advertised program, we are providing direct assistance to parents to help them assist their children in resisting peer pressure to smoke with a new, tobacco-specific booklet called ""Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No.” At this time, TIMN 387494",0
"© 1994 Oxford University Press Nucleic Acids Research, 1994, Vol, 22, No. 25 S695~S701 The fate of deleted DNA produced during programmed genomic deletion events in Tetrahymena thermophila Serge V.Saveliev and Michael M.Cox* Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin, 420 Henry Mall, Madison. WI 53706, USA Recoved August 10, 1994; Revised and Accepted November 4, 1994 GenBank accession nos: U12971 and U12972 ABSTRACT Thousands of DNA deletion events occur during macronuclear development in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. In two deleted genomic regions, designated M and R, the eliminated sequences form circles that can be detected by PCR. However, the Circles are not normal products of the reaction pathway. The circular forms occur at very low levels in conjugating cells, but are stable. Sequencing analysis showed that many of the circles (as many as 50% of those examined) reflected a precise deletion in the M and R regions. The remaining circles were either smaller of larger and contained varying lengths of Sequences derived from the chromosomal DNA surrounding the eliminated region. The chromosomal junctions left behind after deletion were more precise, although deletions in either the M or R regions can generate any of several alternative junctions (1). Some ew chromosomal junctions were detected in the present study. The results suggest that the deleted segment is released as a linear DNA species that is degraded rapidly. This species is only rarely converted to the stable circles we detect. The deletion mechanism is different from those proposed for deletion events in hypotrichous ciliates (2-4), and does not reflect a conservative site-specific recombination process such as that promoted by the bacteriophage \ integrase (5). INTRODUCTION Ciliated protozoa provide examples of multiple types of progratnmied genomic rearrangements (6). These organisms have ‘wo nuclei, a micronucleus and a macronucleus, The ‘mieromucleus is transeriptionaly inactive and isan analog of an inactive germ cell nucleus. The larger macronucleus is teanscriptionally active and is an analog of a somatic nucleus. ‘Nutritional starvation induces cels of different mating types to undergo conjugation, The conjugants exchange haploid gametic nuclei to form diploid zygotic nuclei. Subsequent steps include mitotic divisions of zygotic nuclei the products of which give rise to new micronuclei and macronuclei. Old macronuclei are gradually degraded. In Tetrahymena thermophila, the entire process is completed in about 20 h. Macronuclear development in ciliates is accompanied by a variety of DNA rearrangements, including the elimination of 3 substantial portion of the micronuclear genome (7). la T.thermophita, about 15% of the genome is eliminated in the form of about 6800 site-specific deletion events, averaging 2 Kop insize and scatered about the genome. A striking feature otis type of DNA rearrangement is its high efficiency and precision Deletion ofall the MIC (micronucleus)-specifie sequences occurs ‘during a 2 period of macronuclear development, commencin about 10— 12 after mating is initiated. The mechanism expioited to bring about genomic deletions is unknown, ‘Three site-specific deletions in T.shermophila have been characterized hy Yao and co-workers (6). They occur within & short genomic region and are designated L, M, and R for let ‘middle, and right, respectively. The M region isthe best-stuied Here, two different deletion events may occur, deleting either 600 or 900 bp (Figure 1B). The boundaries of the deleted segments are marked by S$ or 8 bp terminal direct ry although these have no identified role in the deletion process Short polypurine tracts, found about 45 bp distal w each temninal repeat, are required for deletion and represent the only cis-acting sequences defined to dute tora ciliate deletion reaction (8. 9) ‘Their location defines the deetion erapoints inthe M region (9), The polypurine tracts are absent in the neighboring R region, hich also undergoes a deletion of 1.1 kbp (10) A promising direction in the investigation of the mechanism of genomic rearrangements in ciliates is analysis ofthe products fr byproducts that appear during the process. In Euplotes erassus the eliminated fragments derived from the deletion oi ES: elements or the transposon-like Tee and Tee? elements can be detected as circles (11 =13). The circle junctions contain 1wo copies of the terminal direct repeat separated by a short se of heteroduplex DNA derived from the chromosomal 1 Nanking the eliminated segment (2. 3). The data permited the authors to propose a detailed mode! for the deletion mechanism The deleted TBEL elements of Osyzricha mifallax are also found as readly-detected circular species with defined structures (4) We have begun an investigation of genomic deletions in the M and Ro regions during macronuclear development in Thermophila. By weans of PCR techniques we have detected circular forms of the eliminated sequences. However. the citcles are found in much lower abundance than those observed in “To stm core lens sok! be ares",6

From this analysis we calculate that the total number of expressed Vp gene segments may be 21 or fewer, which makes the expressed germline V, repertoire much smaller than that of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain or ligh-chain aenes. We suggest that B-chain somatic diversification is concentrated at the Vj-Dg-Jp junctions BOTH the Ticell receptor and the immunoglobulins are heterogeneous cell-surface glycoproteins that can recognize many antigens’. It is clear ftom genomic analysis that they share similar strategies for diversification, “T-cell receptor molecules are composed of o- and B-chains, each of which, like the immunoglobulin chains, is divided into variable (V) and constant (C) regions», The V regions together form the antigen- binding domain.

Scully), an induswy organization comprising dgarette manufacturers and marketing companies, informed advertising agencies and media organizations today that it will cease running brand-specific Cigarette commercials on television and radio commencing ApHil 1, 1998 as a means of preventing minors fram smoking. According to the Institute, such television comunercials are already banned in mast ofher industrialized nations, including the U.S, due to public criticism; Japan is following sult, albeit rather belatedly.” In addition to the above measures, the industry will also stop placing commercials for individual cigarette brands in motion pictures, on outdoor video sereans and on ‘the Internet. and stop distributing free clgarette samples on public streets. The only television commercials that will still man are those concerning smoking etiquette. ‘The Industry first adopted voluntary rules for cigarette advertising and sales Promotion activities in April 1985. As the rules were revised in the following years, they became more and more stringent. In April 1996, the y were completely overhauled to prohfbit the airing of brand-specific television commerciale before 10:54pm on weeknights, and ts Impose time limits on the volume of cigarette commercials. ‘Hawever, recent surveys have revealed that young people are accounting for an Increasing proportion af late-night (after 11:00pm) television audiences. Te avoid Public criticism questioning the responsibility of manufacturers in regard to smoking among minors, the industry agreed to cut commercials right across the board rather” than establish later airing times. ‘The Institute revealed that the industry would now advertise in mainly adult- orlented magazines and newspapers and increase shop-front sales promotion activities. Although 25 brands are currently being advertised on television and radio, the effect of cutting such commercials is expected to be minimal, given that the broadcasting times had already been severely reduced, 9PLE68EL0Z 22 Dias, Asti esse cis! sepawen +¥ anangoauve wid! rhe",9

This study was undertaken to investigae the influence of cigarette smoke exposures of rats on the pulmonary clesrance of inhaled, felatively insoluble radioactive tracer particles.

"Expression of Human Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor cDNA in Baby Hamster Kidney-derived Cells Results in Autonomous Cell Growth Gera Neufeld,* Richard Mitchell, Phyllis Ponte,* and Denis Gospodarowiez"" ""Cancer Research Institute, University of Californ California Biotechnology Inc., Mountain View, Abstract. Growth factor over-production by responsive cells might contribute to their autonomous prolifera- tion as well as their acquisition of a transformed phenotype in culture. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been shown to induce transient changes in cell behavior that resemble those encountered in trans- formed cells. In addition, several types of human tu ‘mor cells have been shown to produce BFGF. To de: termine directly the rote that bFGE might play in the induction of the transformed phenotype, we have intro duced a human bFGF eDNA expression vector into Asic fibroblast growth factor (bFGE)' is a potent Beware a sin nd mn ells is encoded by 37- and 70-kb mRNA species (6). This mitogen appears to be syathesized initially as a 155 residue protein, which ean be further processed through proteolytic cleavage of its amino-terminal region into two shorter forms (146 and 131 residues). which are as active as the native form (Il), BFGF iy structurally related to acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) (7), and both growth factors interact with the same cell surface receptors (29). Both growth factors trigger a similar range of biological effects, but diftrental activities are apparent. For example, DEGF induces the proliferation and differentiation of responsive cells with a much stronger potency (M4). In vivo, us weil as in vitro, both popides act as potent mitogens and morpho: ens for a similar wide variety of neuroectodermal and rmesenchymal-derived cells (4), including vascular endo: thelial cells (13, 16,17). Recent studies indicate that in vivo, FGF mimics the effect ofthe vegetalizing factor, which is responsible in early embryos (Nenopus laevis, tage 8 blastu- Jae) for the formation of mesenchyme from the animal pole 1, Abreviains ed inti paper: ACE, ovine aden cen deied ‘xp endeal cells AFG aide Bheblast gowth Gtr, BEC. he Sie hbwoblaw grouth fr, BHC 21, Baby hums key eel lin clone 21, 5 eal eum; DF medium, aL: muatre of DME and 2 oka M-CSF ranlacte-mctopbag colony simulating ator, HDL, hi ‘doy lipoprotein HS, heparin Sephrvse: MTT. dnt tira i nitration bromide, evsedprouth Gt, Tok, teasorning goth tse st © The Roker Unnesity Press, 21 982804118610 2.00 The Jornal Cel Haagy: Volume 108, Ape T9K8 G88- 1 fedical Center, San Francisco, Calin 94143: and fornia 94043 baby hamster kidney-derived (BHK-2) fibroblasts One of the BHK transfectants, termed clone 19, ex- presses the DEGF mRNA und produces biologically active bFGF that accumulates to a high concentration inside the cells. These properties correlate with the ability of the cells to grow in serum-free medium without the addition of exogenous bFGF. Clone 19 cells also proliferated in soft agar, indicating that con- stitutive expression of the BEGF gene results in a loss of anchorage-dependent growth. (42). Ltherefore appears that in vivo, FGF can insteuct cells that are destined to diflrentiate into ectoderen wo form nies ‘enchymal tissue instead.

Our approach to this problem is materials oriented. We feel that meeting the objective for this Program will be quite challenging. Nevertheless, because of the strong experience of our proposed research team in closely related catalysis and mate- rial developeent programs, we feel reasonably confident that one or two con cepts for sorbents or catalysts may be demonstrated as feasible. We have structured this program based on a concept development phase and an experimental phase. The project timeline as shown in Figure 1 indicates two milestones or decision points. On a project of this coaplexity, it is neces- Sary to maintain good communications on our progress toward these decision points. In addition to monthly reports and meetings, phone discussions will be used as needed to keep the RJR technical liaison posted on important develop- ments on this project. The searches that you sent us were useful in assisting us in estisating the fuaber of possible references available in a literature search on CO removal from cigarette saoke. It was also useful to note the categories of materials evaluated for sorbents or catalysts. This study is proposed for authorization as a Task under Task Order Agreement No. S48-P-O499R existing between RIR and Battelle. Your return of a fully signed original of this cover letter or providing your letter of authorization, referencing the proposal identification number and the Task Order Agreement, wil] authorize us to start work on this program.

"Activated Bleomycin A TRANSIENT COMPLEX OF DRUG, IRON, AND OXYGEN THAT DEGRADES DNA* (Meceived for publication, April 13,1981) Richard M. Burgert, Jack Peisach, and Susan Bund Horwitz From the Departments of Molecular Pharmacology, Molecular Biology and Cell Biology, Albert Finstein College of Medicine, Brons, New York 10481, “Activated bleomycin” is an oxygenated iron drug complex which embodies the drug's DNA-cleaving ac- tivity. This activity is exercised on DNA, if present, but if DNA is absent, the drug itself is inactivated. Hyper- fine interactions in the EPR spectra of activated bleo- mycin prepared with ""Fe(If) and ""0, demonstrate the presence of iron as Fe(II1) and of bound oxygen ori nating in dioxygen. Bleomycin ean also be activated with Fe(II) and either 1,0; or ethyl hydroperoxide. ‘These latter reactions do not produce a ferrous inter- mediate nor do they require O;. But O. is required for the reaction of activated bleomyein with DNA to yield the malondialdehyde-like chromogens used to monitor DNA degradation. The attack on DNA is quantitatively concurrent with the decay of activated bleomycin, how- ever generated. ‘The antineoplastic antibiotic, bleomycin (1-5), exerts its cytotoxic activity through the breakage of DNA (6). This reaction has been studied in cell-free, defined reaction m tures, bur its mechanism remains elusive. The DNA degra- ation products include nearly equal quantities of free bases and of compounds comprising nucleic base and deoxyribose carbon atoms I to 3 (7), Neither the initial DNA lesion(s) nor the attacking species have been chemically defined (5, 7). Analysis of the drug reactions generating the attacking species ‘now implicates an oxygen-ligated ferric-drug species, which we designate “activated bleomyein.” Both Fe(ll) and , serve as cofactors in DNA cleavage by bleomycin (8-12). This occurs without added Fe(II) if Fe (11) is present together with a reducing agent such as 2-mercap- toethanol, dithiothreitol, or ascorbate, which presumably react to generate Fe(II) (10). Optical stopped flow spectrom etry of O; + Fe(ll)-bleomyein mixtures indicates that an ‘unstable ternary complex forms quickly and yields an optical spectral species closely resembling Fe(II!)-bleomycin (13) ‘The formation of this second species coincides with the ap- pearance of EPR-active material (Scheme 1), We expected these spectral changes to coincide with DNA cleavage but found that the degradation of DNA was far slower (7) and that the DNA-clesving activity was also more persistent. We therefore redirected our attention to events signaled by the * This investigation was supported i pare by United Health Service Grant HI 18390 (.P), United Seates Public Health Service Grant CA“I6714, nd American Cancer Sorely Grant CH-88 (SBA.

This process approximated the time course of DNA cleavage (7,13, 4), suggesting that the two might be related. ‘We have now substantiated this hypothesis and designate the more isotropic and transient EPR species activated bleo- mycin, ‘The presence of this species coincides with DNA- ‘leaving activity in bleomycin reactions either with Fe(ll) and ¢ or with Fe(III) and either H.0, or hydroperoxides. The effect of DNA on the EPR spectrum of activated bleomycin indicates that these materials interact directly. The reactions culminating in DNA cleavage are summarized in Scheme 1.

"Marlboro Lights’ New Label: ‘Underage Sale Prohibited’ _ Ritond Timewatch Star. Waener The ‘Underage Sale Prohibited’ label on the upper corner of a Marlboro Lights pack. Warning added as Clinton hints at tobacco crackdown * By Harry Berkowitz ‘The politically hot issue of cigarette smoking by youngsters took center stage yesterday not ony in the political corridors of Washington, D.C., but at a Phil ‘Morris plant in Richmond, Va. 7 °°"" ~ fm Washington, the White House indicated that! within days, President Bill Clinton may announee' new measures to clamp down on the marketing and | sale of cigarettes to youngsters. Also, National Public Radio aired a Monday inter- view in which Clinton said the nation needs a “tough, and mandatory” program to reduce smoking by teens' and preteens. ‘Meanwhile, Philip Morris, the nation’s biggest | cigarette maker, gathered reporters and. photogta-| phers at its Richmond plant as it started to stamp: ""Underage Sale Prohibited” on one side of Marlboro, Light packs. a ‘The message, which will be on all of its brands by’ -year's end, is part of a program of voluntary measures’ ‘and suggested legislation that the company announced in June to make it harder for youngsters to gain access to cigarettes.

"Second-hand smoke: tS clear the air. Can cigarette smoke in the air cause disease in non-smokers? ThatSan emotional question for smokers and non-smokers alike. Sowell try to set the record straight in the most direct way we know. There is little evidence—and certainly nothing which proves scientifically—that cigarette smoke causes disease among non- smokers. + Youdon't have to take our word for it. US. Surgeon General Julius B. Richmond—who was no friend of smoking—said in his 1979 Report: “Healthy non-smokers exposed to cigarette smoke have little or no physiologic response to the smoke, and what response does occur may be due to psychological factors” Andin the 1982 Report, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop could not conclude that passive smoking is a cause of cancer in non- smokers. The director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Dr. Claude Lenfant, has been one of the tobacco industry’ sharpest . critics. Yet Dr. Lenfant stated in 1980 (and we believe it remains true today) that “the evidence that passive smoking ina general environ- ment has health effects remains sparse, incomplete and sometimes unconvincing” We've decided to speak out on passive smoking because there is so much rumor and rhetoric on this subject today.

Delaware 19807. USA (Received 9 December 1987: Accepted 7 July 1988) NOTICE This material may be protected by copyright aw (Title 17 US. Code). ‘The purpose ofthis paper is to estimate the number of adult deaths per year in the United States from passive smoking, The epidemiological literature on passive smoking and adult morality and cancer and heart morbidity is reviewed. Combined Felative nsks for lung cancer. cancers other than lung. and hheart disease are calculated for each sex and disease category. These date along with estimates of onsmoker death rates and populations exposed allow calculation of annual deaths in each category Reduced relative risk and reduced exposure at older ages are taken into account as well os a correction {for possible miselassfication of smokers as nonsmokers and exposed nonsmokers as nonexpored. Ale together 46.000 deaths per year are calculated consis flung eancer (3000) other eancer (11.000) atid heart disease (32,000). Reasons why such high estimates for other cancer and heart sisesse may be.possible are explored. It is concluded that exposure Introduction Several attempts have been made to estimate U.S. adult mortality from passive smoking. For example. Repace and Lowrey (1985) estimated the lung cancer deaths to be about $000 per year. Fong (1982) estimated total mortality at 10,000 to 50,000. Russell e al. (1986) es- timated total U.S. mortality at more than 4000. The present estimate is based on epidemiological evidence currently available on lung cancer, cancers other than lung. and heart disease. The Surgeon General of the United States (USSG. 1986) and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NRC. 1986) have issued reports stating that passive smoking can cause lung cancer. In the National Acad- emy report the relative risks from the various lung can- cer studies were combined into an overall relative risk using a procedure somewhat similar to that which is used in this work. The Academy report then projects that about 20% of the 12,000 U.S. lung cancer deaths per year among never smokers is due to passive smok- ing. This is reasonably close to the 3000 per year pro- jected here for never smokers plus exsmokers. The methods used in the National Academy report are fur- ther detailed in Wald er al. (1986). Blot and Fraumeni (1986) have also presented an overview of studies of lung cancer and passive smoking. They use a method 29 ‘to environmental tobacco smoke can have adverse long term health effects that are more serious than previously thougl of combining the relative risks from various studies es- sentially identical to that used here. Thus. the proce- dure of combining relative risks from various passive smoking studies to obtain overall relative risks and tighter confidence intervals is now well established by authorities in the field. Also. the method used here to calculate annual deaths from the relative risks appears to be validated by the National Academy results for lung cancer. However. both the Surgeon General's task force and that of the National Academy felt that the data, as of 1986, on cancers other than lung and on heart disease were still too meager to allow calculation of reliable overall risks. Since 1985 considerably new epidemiological infor- mation has become available. particularly on heart dis- ease. This new information is reviewed and combined with the old data to calculate updated relative risks. Overall confidence limits, and estimated annual U.S. deaths from passive smoking and the three main dis- eases, namely, lung cancer. cancers other than lung. and ischemic heart disease. The total particulate matter dose retained by passive smokers is too low to account for the health effects of passive smoking if one starts with the health effects exhibited by direct smokers and ratios down from the dose retained by them. Reasons why such a discrepancy might occur are explored. SLOLESLSEOG",6

"" -- on Monday, January 11, the manager of the Dillard's Hanes Mall store in Winston-Salem announced a revised employee smoking policy which accommodates both smokers and nonsmokers. Previously, manager had announced a ban for all employees in the store. The manager's announcement of the change followed his report of RJR employees complaining about the ban against employees who chose to smoke. RJR employees are being advised of the revised policy through Target Vision and the employee weekly bulletin. New York -- Reports continue to fly that Gov. Mario Cuomo is going to ask the legislature for a package of consumer taxes during his Jan. 19 budget address. A large cigarette excise tax increase, perhaps even a doubling of the current 39 cent tax, will be part of his tax hike plan. FC Elizabeth Gallagher and the Morning Team have prepared a solid grassroots strategy to be implemented upon the Governor's public announcement. Already underway is a concentrated direct connect program to Mr. Cuomo and key legislative leaders. Gallagher has devised a letters-to-the-editor program to commence immediately after the budget address. An activist mail program is being developed, along with a plan to utilize the Action Alert petition signatures collected last year. A news conference of smokers’ rights activists and key anti-tax coalition partners is being scheduled for March. The RJR sales force has been alerted and retailers are being contacted. A special markets program involving FCs Yvonne Roberts and Iucille Lucero is also currently being drafted. iowa -- FC Tom Synhorst reports that the Iowa Health Department's recommendation to increase cigarette excise taxes ten cents per pack, in addition to creating tough new smoking restrictions, is virtually dead. Both Gov. Terry Branstad and the new Speaker of the House have publicly refused to introduce the DOH suggestions. Allen County, IN -- The Allen County (Fort Wayne) Board of Commissioners, according to FC Toby Spangler, have capriciously banned smoking in indoor sporting facilities.

"RJ Reynolds Boosts Wholesale Cigarette Prices >M0 Dy 3/7/97 6:02 PH WW YORK (AP)--The maker of Winston and Canel cigarettes boosted its wholesale prices by about 4% Friday in a move that analysts said could add about a nickel to the retail price of a pack of smokes. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the nation's second-biggest tobacco marketer, inforned its customers late Thursday that it was boosting its prices, effective Friday, to offset rising costs. It was the first increase in cigarette prices since April 1996. Philip Morris USA, the biggest U.S. tobacco maker with brands like Marlboro and Virginia Slims, and other tobacco companies made no inmediate move to match the price hike. But analysts said they expected the industry would do so within days. Enanvel Goldman, who follows the industry for PaineWebber, said the announced increase came about a month earlier than expected, and he said Reynolds probably moved to head off hoarding by wholesalers in anticipation of a price hike. Goldnan estimated the increase in prices paid by wholesalers would result in an increase of about a nickel a pack in the retail price paid by smokers. The retail price of cigarettes varies widely because of different levels of state or local taxes. Reynolds spokeswoman Maura Ellis said her conpany's latest survey indicated the average national retail price of cigarettes was $1.74 a pack. She said Reynolds boosted its charge to wholesalers by $2 per 1,000 cigarettes, which amounts to an increase of 40 cents per carton and 4 cents a pack, But wholesalers and retailers then decide how much to add to their prices before the cigarettes reach consumers. The increase was identical to the last increase 11 months ago. Reynolds saw its share of the domestic tobacco market shrink to about 24.4% last year from 25.3% in 1995, according to the investnent firm Smith Barney. Philip Morris, Meanwhile, saw its share grow to about 48.3 from 47.14. But Goldman said he doubted that the price increase would hurt Reynolds* market share because he expected other tobacco makers would match it. ‘'There is no reason for then not to,'t he said. ‘‘Their expenses are going up and they want to increase their level of profitability."" In addition to Winston and Camel, Reynolds makes Salem and Doral cigarettes as well as other brands. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Reynolds’ parent RIR Nabisco Holdings Corp. gained 25 cents @ share to close at $36.87 1/2 while Philip Morris was up $2.75 a RJR0000000508032297 70020 6038 bigs Leees",2
"813 Original Contributions Localization of Muscarinic Receptor mRNAs in Rat Heart and Intrinsic Cardiac Ganglia by In Situ Hybridization Donald B. Hoover, Ronald H. Baisden, Sylvia X.

The condvcting system contained less message than expected, whereas the intrinsic cardiac ganglia contained more. The mismatch between muscarinic recepior ‘and m2 mRNA densities in the conducting system could not be ‘explained by the local expression of other muscarinic receptor genes, since mi, m3, and m4 mRNAs were not detected at this uscarinic receptors located at a diversity of sites are known to contribute to the neuro- regulation of cardiac fonction. Postjune~ tional cholinergic receptors on the myocardium have ‘been most thoroughly studied and can directly elicit negative chronotropic, dromotropic, or inotropic re- sponses when uctivated by muscarinic agonists or the stimulation of cholinergic nerves.!> Muscarinic recep- tors are also associated with cholinergic and adrenergic nerves in the heart.'** These prejunctional receptors have an inhibitory influence on the release of acetyl- choline and norepinephrine and presumably have a role in fine-tuning the amount of neurotransmitter available to interact with postjunctional receptors. Last, musca- rinic receptors are present on efferent neurons of the cardiac ganglia, where they may have a role in modu- lating ganglionic neurotransmission.""""""? ‘An additional level of complexity has been added by the discovery of multiple muscarinic receptor subtypes. Five muscarinic receptor genes have been identified in molecular cloning experiments, and the corresponding receptor proteins have been designated ml through m5.!\* Heterogeneity of muscarinic receptors has also been documented in functional and radioligand binding, experiments with muscarinic antagonists, Although the ‘Received January 12, 1989; accepied July 20, 194, From the Departments of Pharmacology (D.BLH, SX.X-M) ‘and Anatony (RHLB.), James H.

"CANCER RESEARCH 44,259.26, Jroy 1984) Specific Killing of Human T-Leukemia Cells by Immunotoxins Prepared with Ricin A Chain and Monoclonal Anti-Human T-Cell Leukemia Antibodies’ Benk. Seoit epormen ct Molec mney, Ropu Park Memorial ste Bul, New Yok 14269 ABSTRACT In this study, immunotoxins containing monoctonal ant human ‘call leukemia antibodies are shown to be capabie of specie. kaling of tuna T-leukeria cel in vitro. These immunotoxins were prepared by conjugating rein A chain (RIA) wath our recently generated murine monoclonal ant boskes. SN1 and SN2, the latter of which was obtained trom @ hhybxidoma clone N6/D11 described previously by Negoro and Seon (Cancer Res., 42: 4259-4262, 1982), directed to two ‘nique human T-cel leukemia antigens. We have shown previ= ‘us that these monoclonal antibadies do not react with non leukemia cets nor with vanous normal cells including normal T- cals, thymocytes, and bone marrow cells (Proc. Nat. Acad. So. U.S. A, 69: 845, 1989; Cancer Res., 42: 4259, 1982). Control ‘conjugate was also prepared by conjugating RIA with a mutine monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG), the isotype of which is the ‘Same as that of SNJ and SN2, Le, IgGt-s. In nial experiments, the cytotoxic activity of an SNI IgG-RIA conjugate preparation {and the control IgG conjugate preparation against leukemic T- Cet ines and normal B-cel ines was tested by two different test Procedures, 1e., by measuring direct Killing of the cells and by ‘measuring inhibitory activity against protein synthesis inthe cells In each test. the SN1 conjugate showed specific cytotoxic actv- ity against T4eukemia cels, whereas the control conjugate was. ‘ot cytotoxic against either T-eukemia cells or normal B-cels, ""Nearly compete kiling of T-eukemia cols and inhibition of protein synthesis in T-leukemia cols were observed at the concentra: tions of 10°* to 10°” w of the SN1 IgG:RIA conjugate. {a subsequent experiments, another preparation of SN1 IgGIRIA conjugate and an SN2 IgG:RIA conjugate preparation ‘were tested indvidvaly and together for their inubitory activity ‘aganst protein synthesis in T-eukemia cells and contro cel, With T-leukemia cels, specific inhibition was observed for both SNI IgGRRIA and SN2 IgGRIA. The combined use of these ‘conjugates did not display a synergistic effect. Nevertheless, the combined use of diferent immunotoxins directed to oiferent antigen molecules will be important in cleical use, since uncu- {ured tumor cels derived freshly from patients, in general, dispay heterogeneity with respect to the expression of tumor-associ ‘ated antigens. These immunotoxins may be useful forthe in vitro eradication of tumor cells inthe bone marrow taken from patients with T-cell leukemia. Such tumar celktree bone marrow spec ‘mens wal be very useful in autologous marrow transplantation {o leukemia patients who have received aggressive high-dose ‘chemotherapy and rachotnerepy. ""na was supported patty USPHS ean A104 awarded te Natal coer A unto th New York Site Osperment ot Hein eceved Mach 2, 1983. acepteg Sener 28,198, JANUARY 1984 INTRODUCTION ‘Antibody carriers of toxins. termedimmunotoxins, have drawn ‘considerable attention recently because oftheir promising poten- tian tumor therapy. Preparation of useful immunotoxins requires ‘appropriate specie antibodies; thus, monocional antitumor an- tibodies will be very uselul. We have generated recently and characterized several MCAbs® that are directed to human T-cell leukemia antigens (14, 28), These MCAbs react with T-ALL ceils but do not react with various non-Teukemia cells nor with Various normal cell including normal - and B-cells, thymocytes, and bone marrow ces. In the present study, we selected 2 of these MCAbs, ie., SN1 and SN2, for preparing immunotoxins IMCAb SN2 was obtained from hybxidoma clone N6/D11 de. scribed previously (14)) These MCAbs define unique individual human T-cell leukemia antigons (14, 28) and ate dlrected to itferent antigen molecules as determined by specific immuno- Prociptation followed by SDS-PAGE.‘ Of the toxins, we chose icin, a plant toxin derived from the castor bean, since the Useluiness ofthe antibody: RIA conjugates forthe in vito kiting ‘of tumor celis has been reported already by several groups of investigators (6, 8-11, 15, 18, 28). Tho rcin molecule consists ‘of 2 subunits, an A and a 8 chain, which are inked by a dsulide bond (reviewed in Re. 16). The 8 chain is a lectin which is. pectic for galactose residues present on the surface of a wide variety of cells. The binding of the ricin B chain to mammalian Cells allows the ent of the entire rcin molecule, and conse- quently the RIA, into the cytoplasm whore the A ehain is spit from the 8 chain and acts on the 60S subunit of the iasome to.cause irreversible inhibition of protein synthesis and cell death, Isolated ncn 8 chain binds to cel surfaces butis nontoxic, while isolated RIA is not significantly toxic because ofits inabilty to <tficenty bind to cell surface and to traverse the cell membranes. Thus, conjugates of RIA with appropriate monocional ant tumor antibodies may provide immunotoxins specifically targeted on the tumor cels that react with the antibodies. (ur present immunotoxins of ant-Tleukeméa MCAbs and RIA showed specite kiling of Teukemia ces in vitro. Chnicaluiil- zation of such immunotoxins will be important in view of the facts that T-col leukemia is associated with poor prognosis (1, 2,7. 17, 20, 22, 29) and that autologous marrow transplantation Using leukemia cel-free bone marrow has promising potenti in the cure of patents with T-cell leukemia (see “Discussion"") 2 The abrevatons vies are: MCAD. meno antbody, ALL seve btloste leas S05, ceaum socey! sults, PAGE.

Now that the ordinance is in effect, the City Council should carefully monitor the situation to see that the assurances match reality. Some business owners are predicting they'll face severe hardships unless exempted from the ordinance, which is one of the toughest and most comprehensive in the nation. Nearly all businesses, ‘workplaces and public places, including | building entrances, must be kept smoke-free. Even bars that are exempted from the ordinance must physically isolate smokers so second-hand smoke won't waft into nonsmoking areas. ‘Owners of some restaurants, pool halls, coffee shops and other businesses that catered to smokers are predicting they'll lose customers to neighboring cities. ‘They've pleaded with the City Council to provide variances so they can stay in business. ""So far, the council prudently has opted to make only minor changes in the law. Nothing sparks the wrath of voters — even when tumout is a piddling 15 percent — quicker than officials appearing to negate election results. ‘Doomsayers may also be overstating their case. A study two years ago of 15 western cities that adopted tough anti-smoking ordinances found no effect on. restaurant revenues. Conducted by University of California's Institute for Health Policy Studies, the study focused mainly on cities within urban areas, similar to the Valley, as well as on several in isolated settings. But that doesn't guarantee there won't be exceptions here.

I am pleased to enclose a statement describing policies of The Council and a recent Annual Report that lists grants currently supported. Our application procedure entails a mandatory two-step process. First, a short preliminarv inquiry is sent to members of the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory Board who evaluate it for scientific merit and for ""fit"" into The Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical research program. If the Committee's review vote is positive, you will be provided with forms and instructions for completing a full application. In the event you receive an award, The Council will consider up to two annual renewals on the basis of progress reports and materials submitted with renewal applications. The Council operates two application cycles per year and accepts preliminary inquiries year-round; the date of receipt by CTR determines the cycle in which the proposal is evaluated. - Fall cycle - any inquiry received between April 1 and September 30 and encouraged by the Executive Committee may be submitted as a full application by November 30. + Spring cycle - inquiries received between October 1 and March'31 and encouraged by the Committee may be submitted as full applications by May 3 Cycle Preliminary Ingiry Deadline for Notification Activation Arrival at CTR Full Application Date Date Spring Apr I - Sep 30 Nov 30 Early May Jul Fall Oct 1 - Mar 31 May 31 Early Oct Jan 1 ‘The format for the preliminary application is as follows: 1. A three page narrative summary. This should contain a synopsis of the proposed project including relevant background material, its present status and goals, a brief outline of the research and its impact, The summary should end with a sentence indicating the anticipated duration of the project (one, two or three years) and a single figure estimate of the anticipated annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that the three page limit is absolute; no attachment pages containing photographs, charts or literature citations will be accepted. If you judge such materials are critical for the review of the proposal, they must be accomodated within the three page limitation. 2, Two page curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal professional level collaborators (the NIH format is quite acceptable). Again, the page limit is strictly enforced; only two pages per investigator are forwarded to the Committee. 3. One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely related to the project for which funding is being sought. Sincerely, “Paine maticl Harmon McAllister Encl HCM/mla",0

Golding 257 pp. New York, Cambridge Univer sity Press, 1984. $49.50. ‘The previous generation of health workers has documented the enormous burden of disease and death that tobac- co produces; itis the current gener: tion’s task to apply this knowledge reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by tobacco in this country and abroad. These four books provide use- ful background material for the job ahead. The British journalist Peter Taylor has produced a briskly written book which summarizes the major scientific, ‘economic, and political realities of the tobacco industry. The book begins with ‘an account of the scientific evidence that cigarettes cause cancer, heart dis- case, and emphysema and bronchitis, He relates this with the story of how the deta emerged in the major public hncalth reports on smoking and with sev- eral anecdotes about the tobacco indus- try’s own research on the health effects ‘of smoking. Several examples of the in- dustry’ denial in the face of clear evi- dence are presented. The next chapter summarizes the major features of the great (largely British and American) tobacco com- panies. The origins and interconnec- tions of the six largest multinational firms are presented. ‘When Taylor discusses the mass me- dia's habit of downplaying the relation- ship of smoking and disease, he pro- vides a valuable, behind the scenes ac- count of his own 1976 documentary, Death in the West. This film contrasts the stories of six men from the Ameri- ‘ean West who developed major ciga- rette-associated diseases with promo- tons for Marlboro cigarettes and inter- views with executives from Marlboro's ‘manufacturer, Philip Morris. The film undercuts the seductive appeal of ciga~ rette advertising. Philip Morris suc- ceeded in having the film removed from cireulation in Great Britain, but copies have recently become available again. Death in the West has become part of several innovative school-based tobacco education programs, ‘The remainder of Taylor's book con- tains sometimes over-long accounts of the political maneuvering around ciga~ rettes and health in Great Britain and the United Statesin recent years. These case studies are nonetheless valuable: the ability of the tobacco industry to gain am-advantage in arena after arena is impressive, and Taylor has docu- mented many of the industry's tech- nigues and approaches. Elizabeth Whelan, a public health worker, i also concerned with the so- cial, political, and economic aspects of the tobacco problem. She shares with Taylor the conviction that active. sition from the tobacco industry and its supporters is the major reason that the abundant scientific evidence of harm from smoking has not yet led to effec- tive control measures. Whelan's book is organized into three parts. The first three chapters outline the evidenee that tobacco is a major cause of disease and highlight 14 “ploys” that the tobacco industry has Aeveloped in response to the medical 474 NEW YORK STATE JOURNAL OF MEDICINE/JULY 1985 evidence. This analysis should be help- ful to people whose major information source on the subject has been the mass media. All too often, a news story con- {taining “bad” news about tobacco and disease is “balanced” with distracting and evasive comments from the Tobac- co Institute. ‘The major portion of the book is de- voted to an historical narrative about the problem. This provides a useful overview. For instance, cigarettes only became widely available with the per- fection of mass production machinery in 1884, Mass production itself gener- ated the need for mass promotion; ciga- rette advertising has been an important part of the industry for as long as cig Tettes have been produced by machine. Finally, the third portion of Whelan’s book outlines a variety of actions and activities that can help reduce tobecco consumption. The prescription is broad ‘and unfocused, but this isthe state of the art. What has been tried heretofore has produced few results. Determining the appropriate strategy and assem- ing resources to implement it are the major challenges now facing public health. Whelan has summarized the problem and hes provided a set of sug~ aestions. It is a beginning “The books b jp and Richy ard Kouri and by G. Mangan and J. Golding stand in marked contrast io those of Taylor and Whelan. ‘Henry and Kouri report the results of investigations they conducted while un- der contract tothe Council for Tobacco Research—USA, Inc between 1975, and_J983.

"HJ Reynolds Tobacco Company INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM Wert Sanna HO 27102 RU January 22, 1980 Mr. D. P, Johnson SUBJECT: Leaf Blends Development Project No.: 8392 Project Title: Nicotine Reduction of Leaf Blends There is an apparent concern within the Company for the relatively low level of the tar-nicotine ratio in the smoke produced by. our products. Dr. Laurene discussed this riefly in a meeting with the Research, Development and : Quality Control staffs on January 8, 1980, In discussing the major points of emphasis for the 1980 R&D program, he pointed out that we should approach a solution.to this con- cern for relatively low tar-nicotine ratio levels in our products by considering the tobaccos used in the formulation of then. Perhaps a brief review of the evolution in tobacco usage for the production of cigarettes would clarify our present position. At the time that five non-filtered products made up approximately ninety percent of the domestic cigarette sales, these products were formulated utilizing domestic flue-cured, burley, and Maryland strips to make up approxi- mately eighty-seven percent of the tobacco blend; orventel tobacco made up approximately eight percent, and processed stems about five percent. The casing and flavoring techno- logy was relatively basic and uncomplicated when compared to the technology that exists in the industry today. The technology in filters, filtration efficiencies, cigarette Papers and dilution systems was essentially non-existant and tar-nicotine ratio levels had not been conceived. The domestic tobaccos were selected from farm grades produced in the lower one-half to two-thirds of the plant. The oriental leaf was selected from the ""American Grades"" pro- duced in the upper part of the plant to achieve the rich- ness and fullness of odor and taste imparted to the smoke upon combustion, The advent of the filtered cigarette and the increasing acceptance of these products by the consumer have resulted in enormous changes in the formulation of domestic cigarettes. 6086 ethos",0

I think the statistical studies are not conducted properly, most of them are obtained from death certificates, Just because there is cancer in the lung does not mean that it was primary, it may have been from some other organ in the body, That is one point I think should be investigated, The other point is alveolar cell carcinoma which was reported in Akerman's studies on beagle dogs. It is irrelevant, I think, because Lord Brock in London did a study on alveolar carcinoma which occurs in sheep, and they call it sheeps' disease, He claims, and I think he is right, that it only occurs in animals that are chased or are chasers, which the beagle dog is; it is due to ruming, It is very rare in human beings and I have only seen one case in a doctor here in Baltimore in all of my experience, The third point is, if tobacco causes cancer in lungs why don't the poeple whe use snuff or chew tobacco, whose saliva is impregnanted with tobacco juice ever develop carcinoma of the esophagus or of the stomach? In the past they used to blame carcinoma of the lower lip on pipe smoking, haven't seen a case in years and there are more people smoking pipes now than ever before,",0

"_ inter-oftice Memorandum Subject: Recommendations for Pensweet Pilot Plant Date: September 7, 1971 and Laboratory Studies To: Dr. Murray Senkus Column Operation A. If an adequate dry enzyme supply was available to initiate immediately the pilot plant studies, the following procedure should be used. 1) Pack one double column to a 60 inch bed-depth with hydrated : and pli adjusted enzyme. 2) Start syrup flow at 0.5-0.7 gpm and hold until a constant ~ conversion is obtained and the flow is stabilized. This flow should give a conversion of about 48-49%. 3) Increase the flow until the conversion is stabilized at 45%. 4) Maintain conversion at 45% by manipulation of flow control valve. 5) When flow drops below 0.5 gpm, start a second 60"" bed column in series with the first at high initial flow rates. _ 6) Adjust flow rates to produce 45% conversion; the projected flow rates are 1,0-1.4 gpm. . 7) When flow rates drop below 0.5 gpm at 45% conversion, a third 60"" column is: placed on stream. 8) Adjust flow rate to produce 45% conversion; projected rate will be 1,0-1.4 gpm. 9) Monitor continuously the last column in the series with the —0.R. unit and the preceding colunns at 3 hr intervals to determine conversion. 10) The enzyme life should be determined via a small laboratory column at P&F using the same feed syrups and conditions as projected in the pilot plant. B. Development of alternatives to above plan 1) A series of 4"" glass columns should be set-up in the chemical pilot plant to determine the flow rates at various bed depths with a specific particle size. Low activity cells could be used for these studies. - 2) Aseries of 4"" glass columns should be packed with various sized enzyme particles (15-40 mesh) to determine flow rate and conversion parameters. For initial studies, a 60"" compacted bed is suggested to examine compaction and conversion. 8 ® & o ° 8 puri ron 2422 Rew 3770",0

Among Its diverse array of bic loge functions (reviewed by Paul, 1991) are the abilty to Induce or enhance the expression of major histocompat bilty complex class II molecules (Noolle et al, 1984) and (6023 00 B cals (Conad et al, 1987), its own receptor ‘onlymphocytes (Ohara and Pavi, 1988), and vascular call ‘adhesion molecule 1 on endothalilcolis(Schieimer et al 11992); the ability to induce the secretion ofimmunoglobu- lint (vtotaetat., 1988) andimmunoglobuln (Coffman ‘tal, 1986) while diminishing the immunoglobulin secre- tion of other isotypes: and the ability to act as a growth factor for B calls, T cells, and mast cals (Lee ota, 1986). 40007130 ‘This diverse array of IL-¢-mediated effocts i roflectd in the broad cistibution of IL-4 recoptrs (IL-4Rs).

The molecular cloning of CDNA encoding ‘both the murine IL-4R (mulL-4R) (Mosley etal, 1989; H ada etal, 1980) and human IL-4R (null-4R) (lazerda et ‘al, 1990; Gazz etal, 1990) andthe expression in COST ‘ols indicated that a single chain of ~ 139,000 daltons constituted ahigh-affinityIL-4-binding sito, Recently, thas ‘been shown thatthe IL-2R y chain (common ye) i 4880 ciated with IL-4F in the presence of IL-4 (Russel etal, 1993) and that its presence contributes a 2- to 3d in crease in binding afinty. The IL-4F contains the charac- teristic pairs of cysteine residues and the WSXWS moti found in other members of the hematopoiatin receptor su- perfamily, anit beare one ofthe largest cytoplasmic do- ‘mains, comprised of over 500 amino acids (Cosman, 1983) Like otner members ofthis receptor family, the IL-4F. ‘doesnot contain any consensus sequences characterise of tyosine or serinethreonine kinases. However, actva- tion ofthe IL-4R with IL induces the rapid and striking tyrosine phosphorylation ofa 170 kd protein (Mora et al. 1988; sfortand no, 1990; Wang eta, 1992), called 4PS, ‘a well as phosphorylation of the recoptor itso (Wang et al, 1992; luhnaraandHarada, 1993),suggestingalinkage ‘among the IL-4R, 4PS, anda yrosine kinase. Phosphory- lation of 4S results in its association withthe p85 subunit ‘ofphosphotidylinsite:3kinase P1-3K) andthe subsequent induction of PIK activity (Wang et a, 1992). Interest- ingly. it was found that 4°S is antigenically related to a prominent substrate of tho insulin receptor Kinase, called Inauinocoptor substrate 1(IRS-1) (Sun etal, 1991; Wang ‘tal, 19982). Addition of insulin or nsulin-ike growth fac- tor 1 (IGF-1) resulted in the tyrosine phospherylation of 4PS in myeloid col ines. Furthormor ‘2 myeloid cal line transtectec with the CDNA encoding IRS-* results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and its subsequent association withthe p85 subunit of PLOK, ‘suggesting thatthe IL-4R and the insulin receptor have partially overlapping signal transduction pathways and that IRS-1 and 4PS are functionaly sii thas recently been shown that IL-4 treatment can lead te phosphorylation of RS-1 in nonhematopoietic cells (Pussellatal., 1993).

However, stable L ell transfectants that ‘xpress the 7. showed clear IRS-1 phosphoryation in re- ‘sponse to IL-4.

BeDELL THOMAS, M.D., AND From the Department of Madicine, g Bape. 7 uD. The’ Johns Hophins University Schock Epatonn A. Menpay, M.D. one Baxtotons, Mp. (Received for pubtication Apri 1900) JURING a standard ballistocardiographic smoking test, many different ‘types of circulatory response are found among healthy young adul Some subjects show hyperreactivity of the blood pressure, heart rate, or cardiae ‘output in various combinations, While others with similar smoking habits show Tittle change or even a negative responce. The variations in circulatory reactivity undoubtedly reflect individual differences in homeostasis which may be of con- siderable importarice, particularly: in regard to susceptibility to future hyper- tension or coronary artery dincase. In 1988, Herrell demonstrated that certain Persona with “a tendency toward” hypertension showed dramatic rises of blood Preasure after omoking a cigarette, and in the eame year, Hines and Roth reported, that the most marked elevation of blood pressure during a standard emoking test occurred among patients with essential hypertension. We found that the degree of change in cardiae output in healthy medical students following amoking may’ be related to genctic factora.* Thus the offepring of hypertensive parents showed an exaggerated increase in cardiac output after one cigarette as well a A greater rise in Dlood pressure and heart rate when compared with the offepring oftunaffected parente, On the other hand, the offepring of parents with coronary artery disease showed a more marked diminution in stroke volume and a much smatler increase iy cardiac output after smoking than did the offepring of un- Affected parents. Accordingly. differences in reaponse to the smoking test may be of predictive value in regard to the development of hypertension oF coronary disease at an carly age, on the one hand, or as an index of longevity and relative freedom from cardiovascular disease on the other.

Maximal inhibition of VGF mRNA induction was achieved using K-252a, an inhibitor of the NGF-receptor Trk tyrosine kinase, and by ‘mutating both ¥490 (SHC association site) and Y7RS (PLC-y1 association site) of Trk Inhibitors of the NGF-activated protein {kinase N (PKN) were found to partially and in some cases tran- siently block VGE induction by NGF while in PKA-deficient PCI2 cells, VGF induction by NGF was comparable to that ‘observed in parental PC12 cells. The binding of NGF to Trk ‘therefore activates redundant signal transduction pathways which converge to regulate raf gene expression, Key words: VGE; NGF; Trk; PC12 cal, Protein kinase Ni Protein phosphorylation otroduction In the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) but not epidermal growth factor (EGF), PCI2 pheochromocytoma cells differentiate into sympathetic neuron-like cells (1). Treatment of PC12 cells with [NGF results inthe rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of maltiple cellular proteins 2] and the stimulation of several second mes- Senger pathways through the actions of a number of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases (3). The importance of protein phosphorylation in the mechanism of action of NGF has been reinforced by the identification of the product of the rk tyro- sine kinase protooncogene as the high affinity NGF receptor [4.5]. and the demonstration that Tek is a necessary component of the NGF signaling pathoray that is required for neurite outgrowth and the promotion of PC12 cell survival (6) NGF-treatment stimulates p21"" GTP-binding activity, caus- ing protonged p21™ and ERK activation in comparison to * Corresponding author.

Selective inhibition of protein kinase activity through the application of purine analogs inhibits NGF-promoted neurite regeneration and the NGF-regulated serine/threonine protein kinase N (PKN) but does not block several other effects of NGF [8-10] suggesting that the develop- tment and maintenance of a neuronal phenotype results from the complex regulation of « number of protein kinases. Insight into the process of neuronal differentiation may be obtained through study of gene products such as VGF {11} which are rapidly activated more robustly by NGF than by EGF. in contrast to transcripts of the immediate early genes fos, un, and =i268 (NGFI-A), which appear to be induced similarly by cither NGF, EGF, or serum stimulation {12}. In PC12 cells, YGF mRNA levels increase atleast 15-30-fold after 3-6 h of [NGF treatment and return to basal levels after approximately 48 h (13,14), Induction of raf gene expression is mimicked by activation of a Sre-Ras-Raf cascade in PC12 cells (15), and is partially blocked by protein synthesis inhibitors [16,17] and downregulation of protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent path- ways [14] Here we utilize a numberof protein kinase inhibitors, several PC12-derived cell lines that express wildtype or mutant forms of Trk, and a PKA-defcient PC12 cell ine to characte ize the relative contributions of specific signal transduction pathways to the regulation of vgf gene expression by NGF. 2, Materials and methods 2d, Cell extare CID ces PCL2anr5 cell lines expressing wildtype and mutant Tks (generously provided by Dr LA.

LAGARIAS AND KATHRYN RADKE* Department of Avian Sciences, University of California, Davis, California 95616 Received 14 September 1984/Accepted 8 February 1989 Infection by bovine Jeukemia virus (BLV) Is characterized by a long latency period, after which some individuals develop B-cell mors. The behavior of BL and related retroviruses during the latency period Detween initial infection and subsequent tumorigenesis Is poorly understood. We used in situ hybridization to detect BLV transcripts In individual peripheral bloed mononuclear cells from experimentally infected, ‘asymptomatic sheep with latent infections. Viral RNA was not found in most peripheral blood cells that had been isolated as rapidly as possible from circulating blood, but it was. present in rare cells. BLY RNA transcripts increased in a biphasic manner within a few hours after the blood cells were placed in culture. Exposure to fetal bovine serum was identified as the principal cause of this transcriptional activation, which ‘occurred in fewer than 1 in 1,000 cells. Agents knovn to activate immune cells polyclonally caused a further increase inthe numberof cells containing BLY RNA within §h. In some cases, the numbers of vial transcripts, within individual cells also increased. Thus, BLY is not detectably expressed io most resting lymphocytes, ‘ireulating in the blood, but its transcription is activated by components of fetal bovine serum and can be augmented by molecules that mine activation of immune cells. This activation, which might occur in lymphoid {Ussue during an imouune response, may lead to the synthesis of viral regulatory proteins that are thought (o Initiate tumorigenesis through host cell genes. Bovine leukemia virus (BLY), human T-cell leukemia virus types I and Il (HTLV-I and HTLV-lI, respectively), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ate all retrovi- rises that replicate in cells of the immune system. Infection by these viruses is followed by a long latency period, and a certain proportion of infected individuals then rapidly prog- ress to terminal disease. Because these viruses integrate essentially at random into the host genome and do not contain cell-derived oncogenes, it is thought that the viral gene products themselves lead to development of disease ‘The genomes of BLV, HTLY, and HIV encode crans-acting factors that regulate viral transcription, but litle is known about how viral transcripts that encode these regulatory proteins are initially induced. For HIV, recent evidence ‘Suggests that immune responses to unrelated antigens trigger virus replication and contribute (o disease progression (re- viewed in reference 15). BLY, HTLY-I and HTLV-t are tumorigenic retroviruses that cause leukemia and lymphoma (reviewed in references 4 ‘and 53) and are distinet from HIV, a lentivirus that causes fatal immunodeficiency and neuropathy of the central ner- ‘vous system (reviewed in reference 15). BLV and HTLV-I share numerous features of infection and pathology. They also have similar genomic structures (43) and use common ‘strategies for gene expression. The 3” ends ofthe genomes of| HTLV and BLY contain the X sequences encoding a set of| novel proteins (30, 39, 41, 45) that are necessary for ecient transcription from the viral promoter (7, 11, 40) and that determine the relative proportions of spliced and unspliced transcripts (12, 25, 27). Aside from host range, a notable difference between the two viruses is that BLV infection is associated with malignancy of B cells, whereas HTLV affects T cell. ‘Corresponding author. ‘Tumor cells contain at least part of one provirus, but the viral genome is not detectably expressed (16, 28), which suggests that viral gene products are not necessary 10 maintain the transformed state. The X proteins encoded by the virus may set in motion a series of events leading 10 secondary genetic changes that result in malignant transfor- mation (54). Its important for two reasons to know where ‘and under what conditions viral genes are expressed before tumor development begins. () Intermittent production and spread of the virus would favor transformation simply by increasing the population of cells at risk for such a genetic change. (i) It is possible that the X-encoded proteins, tax and rex, could be produced from a subgenomic message without production of virions and that tax itself is responsi ble for changes in cells that could lead to uncontrolled srowth (19, 26, 33) BLV-specific RNAS have not previously been detected in RNA extracted from populations of monontclear cells newly purified from the blood of infected animals (20,29), but BLY Ueanscripts were detected once these cells’ had been ia short-term culture (20). However, low-level transcription in «few cells might escape detection unless individual cells were examined for viral transcripts, Virion proteins and particles have been detected in a few cells as early as 3 to 6 bb after initiation of blood cell cultures but were most abundant after 24 to 48 h of culture (3, 14, 49). To examine infected cells during the latency period, when virus expression is likely to be important in disease devel- opment, we studied transcriptional activation of the BLY provirus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from infected but asymptomatic sheep that had no elevation of lymphocyte counts. We have found that the number of cells that act as infectious centers in culture is extremely low during latency. typially about 1 in 10* cells (submitted for publication), Here, the single-cell sensitivity of in situ by~",6

Key words: bovine forebrain/dexetimide digitonin See Introduction The neurotransmitter acetylcholine elicits rapid responses by interacting with nicotinic receptors (nACHRS) and slower elfects via muscarinic receptors (mACHRs). Muscarinic ‘Tesponses are observed in the central and peripheral nervous system as wel as in muscle and in glands and represent alarge proportion of the acetylcholine-mediated effects. Due to the exrzordinarily high number of nAChRs found in the post synaptic membrane of the electromotor synapses of electrie fish, knowledge of the mechanism and structure of mACHRS has increased tremendously in recent years (Changeux, 1981). ‘Advances in research on mACARs have been much less rapid. This i due to the lower concentration of mACHRs, together with the fact that these receptors have not yet been purified. Earlier radioligand binding studies revealed that mAChRS are discrete membrane components which recognize an- tagonist and agonist molecules (Gorissen etal. 1978; Birdsall et al, 1979; Haga, 1980). As is the case with many other receptor systems, the two types of ligands appear to differ in their mechanisms of interaction in the following way: only agonists induce receptor desensitization in intact cell preparae tions (Klein ef a, 1979; Simon and Klein, 1979): the recep. tors are composed of different subpopulations with the same affinity for antagonists but different affinities for agonists Birdsall eral, 1978; Ehlert eral, 1981); guanine nucleotides ‘To whom reprint requests shouldbe set. © IRL Pres Limited, Oxford, England ‘and Mg?* ions have opposite effects on agonist affinity but ‘no effect on antagonist binding (Ehlert etal, 1981; Wei and Sulakhe, 1980; Sokolovsky et al. 1980); and Finally, agonists bot not antagonists induce conformational changes in the receptors (Vauquelin et af, 1982). mACHRS have been successfully solubilized with a wide variety of detergents, of which digitonin appears to be the ‘most effective (Gorissen et al, 1981; Ruess and Lieflander, 1979; Hurko, 1978; Aaronstam ef a., 1978; Repke and Mat. thies, 1980). ‘An affinity gel with high affinity for mACARS (Repke ef al. 1980) has been described recently and a purification of hydrophobic mAChR and nACHR proteins ‘was attempted earlier (Barrantes ef a, 1975). We report here the first successful purification of mACHRS, These receptors were solubilized with digitonin, purifted by absorption on an affinity gel with dexetimide followed by selective elution with the MACHR antagonist atropine or with the highly specific irreversible ligand propylbenzilyicholine mustard (PrBCM). ‘The radiciodinated purified proteins were analysed by SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).

Introduction Polypeptide growth factors meciato their physiological re- sponses by binding oand acvatingcol surface receptors with intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activities (reviewed in Ulich and Schlessinger, 1990) Both receptor activation ‘and yrosine autophosphoryation wore shown tobe med josterie Intermolacular process (reviewed in 1968). Receptor autophosphorylation ap- ‘pears to bo essential for association witha group of cyto plasmic target protain (reviewed in Koch et al, 1991; Heldin, 1981; Margols, 1982). Following binding, cortin target proteins. such as phospholipase C-y (PLO-) be- ‘come tyfosine phosphorylated and activated (Me'sen- elder etal, 1989; Wah at al, 1969; Margolis et a, 1989; Kazlauskas and Cooper, 1889; Kim st al, 1991). Other target proteins, such as phosphoinositide (P19) kinase. associated p85, function as adaptors or regulatory sub- ‘nits to couple tyrosine kinase receptors to effector pro- ‘sine (Cantey etal, 1991; Hu etal, 1992; MeGlade ot al. 1992). The assoc'ation between signaling proteins and growth factor receptors strictly dependent upon tyrosine phos- phoryaton of specific short sequence motifs. short con: ‘sensus sequonce was described inthe kinase insert r6- ‘gon of the platelet-derived growth factor (POGF) and colony-stimulaing factor 1 receptors and shown to act as. binding site for PL3 kinase-associated p85 (Kaziauskas ‘and Cooper, 1990; Cantley ot al, 1991; Escobedo otal, 19912; Reed etal, 1982). Another sequence moti was. found inthe carboxy-terminal als of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) and shown to act as a binding sto for PLC», (Margolis ot al.,1990a, 19900; Mohammadi et a, 1991, 1992; Rotin et al, 1992a). These autophosphoryation sites in growth factor receptors represent recognition tructue® for speci target proteins containing sre ho: mology 2 (SH2} domains. SH2 domains are conserved ‘sequences of approximately 100 2a found in various sig ‘naling molecules and oncogenic proteins (reviewed in Koch et al, 1997; Heidin, 1991; Margolis, 1992). SH2 do- mains have been found in a diverse group of proteins, ‘some containing enzymatic activities, such a5 PLC, ‘GTP ase-actvating protein, and pp6o""™ (Stan ota, 1988 ‘Suh etal, 1988; Sadowsk ta, 1988; Vogel etal, 1988; Trahy et al., 1988), while others, such as nck, vcrk, and 185 (Lehmann etal, 1990; Mayer etl, 1988, 1982; Sol niketal, 1991; Otsu et al, 1991: Escobedo etal, 1991b). lack any apparent enzymatic activity.

"Cancer Policy Board Urged To Study Access, Research Funding, Tobacco Research funding, tobacco control and access to health care and clinical trials were among the policy issues that cancer advocacy and professional ‘organizations urged a new, potentially influential board to address. Testifying before the National Cancer Policy Board at its first public meeting March 31, representatives from 14 professional and voluntary. health organizations said the board could provide public service by addressing difficult issues confronting cancer research and clinical care. The board was established earlier this year by the National Academy of Sciences and Institute of Medicine at the request of NCI Director Richard Klausner. Board members were selected from a variety of fields related to oncology, including clinical and basic research, prevention, drug development, health services, patient care, and patient advocacy. Following the tradition of other NAS advisory sroups, the board plans to conduct workshops, commission papers, issue reports, and render advice conceming isues in cancer research, prevention, and delivery of care, according tothe board's background statement. Peter Howley, the policy board chairman and an of the Department of Pathology, Harvard I School, said the board plans to outline its priorities in a paper tobe released by the end of May. However, the board would take at least a year to develop its frst major report, Howley said. ‘The board formed working groups to study three topics which would likely develop studies or ‘workshops: tobacco control, biomedical research, and healthcare services and health services esearch Appoints New Members In another development, 1OM appointed three additional persons to the board, bringing its membership to 20: ‘© William Roper, senior vice president and chief medical officer for Prudential Health Care, of Roseland, NJ.

Richter “Walther Steaub-tnstvt far Pharmakologie und Tontkologie der Ludwig-Maximilians- Universit, MGnchen, Geemany Abstract: Nicotine and its major metabolite coti- fine inhibit a-hydroxylation of the tobacco-specif- ic nitrosamine 4-methylnitrosamino)-1-G-pyridyD- L-butanone (NNK) suggesting that an alternative pathway of NNK metabolism and elimination, bit- lary exeretion of the O-glucuronide of 4-(methyl- nitrosamino)-1-G-pyridyl)-L-butanol_ (NNAL-Gluc) ‘may be enhanced. To verify the possible role of cotinine on biliary elimination of NK and its me- tabolites, bile duct cannulated rats were adminis- tered a Single ip. dose of 50 mg/kg [5-2HI-NNK with or without ip. co-administration of 5 mg/kg. cotinine or nicotine. Cotinine significantly re~ duced cumulative bile flow and biliary elimination of NNK-derived radioactivity within six hours to, 42 and 27 percent, respectively. The pattern of NNK metabolites in bile was unchanged. Nicotine | had 2 similar inhibitory effect on bile flow. This, | result constitutes the first experimental evidence that cotinine inhibits bile flow. In rats, biliary elimination of NNK is reduced accordingly which, i may lead to an increased carcinogen burden in the body. In humans, inhibition of bile flow by to- bacco alkaloids may contribute to the appetite suppressing effect of tobacco products. | @ inactivation | maar ghee gtr okr-ot Fig. 1.

A company spokesman, Larry Wexler, added that the nationwide recall—-the first in his memory — involves “less than a week's worth of production, Philip Morris U.S.A. makes about 43 billion cigarets a week. ‘The road to the recall began week ayo, when an unusual ‘odor was detected in raw ma- terials used to make filters. By Wednesday, tests had re- vealed the presence of methyl isothiocyanate in the filters of some cigarets. ‘The affected cigarets were placed on hold, but on Thurs: day subsequent testing dis: closed the presence of the chemical in cigarets without the odor — raising fears that the tainted product already might have been sent to wholesalers. Wexler said the company has not heard from any con- sumers so far. “We're just be- ing overly cautious,” he said Philip Morris said consum- ers with any of the listed brands should return the Packs to a retailer that carries the product for a refund, Consumers, wholesalers or retailers with questions may call (800) 757-2555, 24 hours @ day, seven days a week. > ag 0 L1Q0E08 OZ",9

All compounds were assayed both in the presence, and absence of liver homogenate from Aroclor-treated rats. Among the aminocarbazoles, 2-aminocarbazole was found to be most active in both tester strains, although somewhat less active than 2-aminofluorene. 3-Aminocarbazole was the only other isomer that was mutagenic towards TA98 at the dose levels employed (5-200 jg). 4-Aminocarbazole was moderately active in TA100, and I-aminocarbazole was inactive in both TA98 and TA100. Similar differences in mutagenic potency and specificity towards the tester strains were observed for the related series of nitrocarbazoles. ‘The mutagenic and carcinogenic activity of various heterocyclic aromatic amines has been actively investigated in recent years, The isolation and structural elucida- tion of 3-amino-SH-pyrido[4,3-6lindoles, 2-amino-dipyridof1,2-a:3',2""-d imidazoles, 2-amino-5-phenylpyridine, 2-amino-9H-pyridol2,3-bjindoles, and 2-amino-imidazo- [45 Jquinotines (Sugimura et al., 1977; Yamamoto ‘et al., 1978; Yoshida et al, 1978; Kasai et al., 1980) as potent mutagenic components present in protein Pyrolysates and cooked food have contributed to interest in their potential ‘toxic effects.

"( 10-57 Determination of Secondary, Tertiary, and Total Alkaloids in Tobacco* By C. L. OGG (Eastern Regional Rescarch Laboratory, Agricultural Research Service, US. Department of Agriculture, Philadelphia 18, Pa.) WILLIAM W. BATES, JR, EVERETT COGBILL* LEE S$. HARROW; ond ELMER L. PETERSEN‘ ‘The results of last year’s studies (1) dicated that cortain changes in the Cundi ‘Marianas and in the so-called “tentative” methods were needed. ‘Subsequently, the Cundiff-Markunas method (2) was modified (3) to inerease the recovery of nornicotine from tobacco and to eliminate the necessity for potentiometric titration when high nor- nicotine tobaccos were encountered. These modifications, made by the authors of the original paper, were: (a) the uso of sodium hydroxide in placo of barium hydroxide to liberate tho alkaloids, and (b) the addition of gincial acotic acid to the acotylated sample before titration with pereblorie acid. Also, the 1958 studies showed that Griffith's methoul was a little more efficient in recover- ing alkaloids than the tentative method; ently, & new procedure was written istillation conditions of Grif- fith (4) bat permitting the use of any of the conventional apparatus, including Griffith's. ‘Tho two modified methods and five tobacco . samples wore sent to collaborators with the request that samplés be analyzed in «upliento and that all data be reported on forma sip plied. In addition to having a choico of stills in the distillation method, the collaborators were allowed to choose between the gravi- metric and spectrophotometrie methods for ‘measuring the alkaloids distilled. Four of the five samples, the flue cured, Turkish, Mary- land, and cigar filler, were the same tobaccos used in 1958, but tho burioy tobnero was replaced by a new sample with a higher alka loid level. The samplex, which had been ground to pass a 1 mm sieve and had been mixed well, wero oquilibrnted in air and sealed in screw-capped give jars. The sam- ples were to be analyzed “as roccived” and the data reported on the same basis. METHODS A.

The vast majority of studies used a surrogate for ETS ‘exposure (meialy paternal smoking), without verification of such exposure ‘with e biochemical marker. Toe sample sizes of the studies ranged from under 100 subjects to almost 25,000 subjects. Most studies employed regression snalysis. A considerable variation from study to study was noted in the weat- ‘ment of potential confounding variables and most stidies considered relative- 1y few of these. Most ofthe individual confounding variables were considered {na relatively small proportion (one third or less) of the srudies. The majority (Gimost two thirds) of the studies failed to demonstrate a statistically signif cant association between ETS exposure of the pregcant woman and low birth- ‘weight. This general leck of consistency of association could reflet absence of an adverse effect of ETS or methodologic difficulties such as misclassification ‘error, type Tl error, recall bias, o inadequate adjustment for potential con- ature, it was concluded at the time that there was litde’ evidence of such an association.

(E) Light Seattering KR. W. Detenbeck The scientific study of light scattering began in 1869 with the experiments of Tyndall, who sent a beam of white light through a suspension of fine particles. The scattered light ‘sas bluish and, observed at right angles to the beam, was, hichly polarized. These effects suggested to Tyndall thatthe ‘Nue color and polarization of ight from the sky are produced 1m the scattering of sunlight by atmospheric dust. In a sub- sequent, theoretical treatment Rayleigh calculated the scat- ‘ering from a random collection of small (compared with a \savclength), widely separated spheres. He predicted the ob- served polarization phenomena, as well as the inverse- fourth-power dependence of scattered intensity on wave- length which gives the sky its blue color. That the blue color an4 Polarization were most striking in the clearest skies led sleigh to conclude that the molecules of air itself, not “led dust particles, are responsible for the blue sky. Wavefronts propagate straightforward within a homoge- ‘ous medium, and the effect of the medium is described {erm ofits average electromagnetic properties. Light se ‘ers when it passes through a medium that contains inho- Light Scattering 635 rogeneities on the scale of a wavelength, These may be embedded particles as in Tyndall's scattering experiments, ‘or the molecules of the medium itself, as in Rayleigh’s theory Of the blue sky, However, Rayleigh’s molecular theory ap- plies only to gases, where itis proper to add the intensities of light scattered by individual molecules. In condensed mat- ter the medium is quite homogeneous on the scale of optical ‘wavelengths, and the coherent addition of scattered ampli- tudes cancels radiation inal but the forward direction. Using 2 different model suggested by Smoluchowski, Einstein in 1910 described the weak light scattering from liquids in terms of thermodynamic density fluctuations within small volume elements of a continuous medium Descriptions of light-scattering phenomena can be clas sified as static or dynamic. Static descriptions include time- averaged angular distributions of scattered intensity and po- larization. One interesting case is the scattering of linearly polarized light from a single particle, ilustrated in Fig. 1. IF the scattering takes place within a surrounding medium of index re, and the vacuum wavelength of the incident light ‘beam is Ao, the incident wave vector has magnitude ky = 2ranlhy. The scattered light has wavelength As, and the mag- nitude of ts wave vector is ks = 2an/As. The incident beam propagates in the direction of the vector ko, and the scattered light travels from the particle to the detector inthe direction of ks. The two wave vectors determine the scattering plane, in which the scattering angle between them is denoted by 8. Inacommon arrangement the incident light is polarized with its electric field aligned along the normal to the scattering plane, often called the vertical direction and denoted here by the unit vector ey. The detector may select either the vertically polarized component or the horizontal component, with electric field aligned along ey. Electromagnetic scattering from a particle remains an in- teresting theoretical problem in itself. The exact solution for the scattering from an isolated sphere was obtained by Mie in 1908, but the only other exact solution fora finite particle, an ellipsoid of revolution, awaited the work of Asano and LIGHT SOURCE Dw % 4 DETECTOR s tS K Fic. 1.

"DNA AND CELL BIOLOGY Volume 14, Number 5, 1985 Mary Ann Liebert, In, Pabishers Pp. 388-371 Review Article Schizosaccharomyces pombe: A Model for Molecular Studies of Eukaryotic Genes YUQI ZHAO! and HOWARD B. LIEBERMAN ABSTRACT Several features of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe make it exceptionally well suited for the study of eukaryotic genes. Its a relatively simple eukaryote that can be readily grown and manipulat the laboratory, using a variety of highly developed and sophisticated methodologies. Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells share many molecular, genetic, and biochemical features with cells from multicellular organisms, making ita particularly useful model to study the structure, function, and regulation of genes from more complex species. For examples, this yeast divides by binary fission, has many genes that contain introns, is eapable of using mammalian gene promoters and potyadenylation signals, and has been used to ‘clone mammalian genes by functional complementation of mutants. We present a summary of the biology of S. pombe, useful features that make it amenable to laboratory studies, and molecular techniques available to manipulate the genome of this organism as well as other eukaryotic genes within the fission ‘yeast cellular environment. INTRODUCTION [UMEROUS FEATURES OF THE FISSION YEAST Schizosac- ‘charomces pombe make it an attractive model system for molecular genetic studies of eukaryotic genes. This small, relatively simple eukaryote possesses many of the same fundamental cellular properties of larger, multicellular ‘organisms. However, itcan be manipulated inthe laboratory readily and has 2 relatively short doubling time, making it amenable to many types of experiments, Furthermore, 5. pombe has a relatively small genome size, approximately 1.5 10” bp in the haploid state, which is about three times larger than that of Escherichia colt. Another useful feature of S. pombe is that it usually exists as 2 haploid organism. This characteristic facilitates the creation and identification of ‘mutants. In addition, cells can be mated to construct strains with desired genetic backgrounds and to study genes in haploid as well as diploid cells. Haploids, diploids, and fetrads can be purified and used for subsequent genetic analysis ‘The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been studied extensively. Therefore, wat makes S, pombe, at the Jeast, another attractive model system for studying eukary- otic genes? Even though S. cerevisiae and S. pombe are both ascomycetes, they are not very closely related evolution- atily. Protein sequence comparisons have indicated that S. pombe is nearly as distant from S. cerevisiae as it i from mammals (Russell, 1989), At the gene level, mammalian introns can be spliced properly in fission yeast (Kaufer etal, 1985), and introns within S. pombe genes are also appropri- ately spliced when acomponent ofthe yeast spliceosome, U2 snRNA, is replaced by a human equivalent (Shuster and Guthrie, 1990). In addition, mammalian promoter and poly(A) signals are functional in S. pombe but not i cerevisiae (Russel, 1989). The conservation of gene activity between S. pombe and mammals was clearly demonstrated ‘Centr for Radiological Research, Collee of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia Univenity, New York, NY 10032, ""Present addes: Department of Pediatrics, Northwestem University Medial Center, 2500 Cildren's Plaza, Chicago, IL 60614 359 50554416",6

Senator Earle Clements The Tobacco Institute, Inc. 1776 K Street, Northwest Nashington, D.C. 20006 Dear Senator Clements At Mr. Galloway's suggestion, I have written each chief executive of five tobacco companies of our intent to develop a program on tobacco research of major significance at Harvard. T enclose that correspondence for your interests. The size of the program, and its eventual success and productivity, will depend most directly on the magnitude of support provided by the tobacco industry. I want to see as good and as large a program as we can develop at Harvard, and I want to see it functional just as soon as possible. As I have stated many times now, I also want the tobacco industry to be deeply involved, on a collaborative basis, in our research. It is very difficult for us to work administratively with so many representatives from the various tobacco companies. The one person who has stood head and shoulders above the rest in providing administrative leadership and guidance, from the standpoint of the tobacco industry, is Jack Roemer of R.J. Reynolds Industries. It was Mr. Roemer who convinced me that I had a responsibility to help solve the tobacco controversy and I can assure you that without his help I would never have becone involved in a major way. Mr. Roemer also has the ideal image and character to work with the academic leaders at Harvard. Although he is with Reynolds, it is of crucial importance to us that he be able to act as a spokesman for the entire industry relative to our developing a program here. I hope that you, with your wisdom and diplomacy, can help implement that. If there is anything more I can do at this time, please let me know. I hope we can get together again in Washington in the near future. Warmest regards Ohiga flrs hoc / cord tener, wi?

"RJR Interoffice Memorandum Subject: Highlights Date: April 28, 1992 To: Brenda Hodge From: Robert A. Heckman Prelininary Assessments of Outside Laboratory Methods for Pesticides An unusually, large nunber of analytical methods were submitted to the CORESTA Pesticide Sub-Group for consideration at its recent meeting (meeting report to follow). Several of these methods were practiced by several menbers of my roup and myself in the months and weeks prior to the meeting which convened in famburg, Germany on April 20th. Sone of our findings, which were diplomatically disclosed at the meeting, are summarized below. §C Method for MH-30. Contributed by J. K. Renaud of Philip Morris Europe. ‘This method entails a two-hr extraction of tobacco with 2N HCI containing a derivitizable internal standard {formerly barbital, but revised to G-methyluracil), followed by neutralization and in situ methylation with dimethyl sulfate. Not having access to barbital, I synthesized and Characterized the 0,N-dimethy] derivative of HH-30 and used it as external standard for GC analysis using NPD as prescribed. The recovery of MH-30 using ‘this approach a derivitizable internal standard was 37%. Other concerns are the acute toxicity of dimethyl sulfate, relegation to use of a NPD detector, and responsiveness of the method to bound’residues of MH-30 that are cnown to exist. HPLC Method for HH-30. Contributed by G. Lionetti of the Italian Honopoly. This method involves a 2N HC) extraction of tobacco, followed by passage of the extract through C-18 and analysis by HPLC using a C-18 column. We practiced this method intensely several weeks prior to the meeting and found an interference in untreated tobacco in the amount of 89 ppm. This was communicated at the CORESTA Sub-Group meeting. Since the delegates from Zimbabwe also stated that the method ""does not work,"" I doubt that this direct approach will receive further serious attention internationally. HPLC Method for Kethoprene. Contributed by S. S. Yang of Philip Morris USA. {big method involves a simple tsopropanol extraction of tobacco, followed > HPLC as described by RUR, but using diode array detection. This method, which has a limit of detection’of 1 ppm, was also practiced intensely by us pkior to the meeting. Although we have seen this approach used successfully at’ Dibril, we have not achieved satisfactory chromatographic performance in-house using conventional variable wavelength detection. Conversations with Dr.. Yang revealed that the method may be very sensitive to injection size. This direct approach for high levels of methoprene will be studied further by us and several other CORESTA affiliates. 8 e 8",0

Several measures of Sttetion allocation filed to confiem the hypothesized cognitive mechanisms, however. Implications ofthe findings ae discussed. ‘Key wonde:cigazette smoking, nicotine, mood, station, anxiety Research has revealed that nicotine is reinforcing in both animals and humans (Heaningfield & Goldberg, 1983). Nevertheless, there has been some difficulty in clearly determining the underlying mechanisms that explain why tobacco smoking is reinforcing, Researchers have put forth a host of theories, calling pon constructs as disparate as arousal modulation, performance enhancement, withdrawal relief, differential cevebral activation, release of endogenous “opioids, and peer group identification, When asked, cigarete ‘smokers themselves consistently attribute their smoking, in ‘Breat part, t0 its ability to reduce subjective stress and snxicty (Fith, 1971; Spiclberger, 1986). Correspondingly. field studies (Conway, Vickers, Ward, & Rahe, 1981) and laboratory (C. §.

One interpretation of these inconsistent findings is that if cigarette smoking does reduce tension, it does s0 indirectly fF in interaction With other factors, and not through some direct pharmacologic effect (cf. Steele & Josephs, 1990). Tt is important to note that other drugs of abuse evidence similar inconsistencies with respect to their ability to allay ‘unpleasant emotions. Alcohol, in particular, shaces this puzzling effect (Sayerte, 1993; Steele & Josephs, 1990). In fn attempt to reconcile disparate findings in the literature, ‘Claude Steele and his colleagues have proposed an aitention- allocation model of alcool reinforcement (Steele & Jo- Sephs, 1990), The thrist ofthis mode! is that alcohol affects ‘mood indirectly, through its effects on cognition and pereep- tion, rather than through any direct pharmacologic effect. ‘The model also implicitly draws on the literature suggesting that anxiety (as well as other mood states) are attentional mediated (Beck & Clark, 1988; Eysenck, 1988, 1992; ‘Williams, Watts, MacLeod, & Mathews, 1988). Specifically, alcohol appears both to impair individuals” bility to engage in controlled, effortul cognitive processing and to induce attentional narrowing (ef. Easterbrook, 1959; Wacht, 1967) such thatthe drinker cannot attend to as many stimuli as he for she could when not drinking. Hence, when stressed drinkers are engaged in a pleasant distracting activity that requires attention and thought, alcohol’s reduction of both 2082334416",6

School boards in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Atlanta and many other cites banned apples and apple products from their cafeterias. Some parents raced after their children’s school buses to yank apples ftom their lunch boxes. Supermarkets came under intense pressure to remove apples form their shelves. Uniroyat, the manufacturer of Alar; pulled the product off the market. Sales of apples plummeted, forcing many farm- ex to dump their erops or ive them away—costing the industry ‘more than $100 million, according to economists’ estimates. Reaction to the Alar scare ""set a troubling precedent,” the ‘Washington Post editorialized several weeks later. “A com cated scientific issuo was allowed to be decided not by officials ‘hare. with protecting. th public, on the-Basis:of Rar evi <dence, bat bya fiightened pubic acting on incomplete and often ‘efroncous press reports."" “The EPA had expressed concern about the safety of Alar for many years before Newsweek and ""60 Minutes"" jumped on the story. But the agency had docided that test results were ei ther flawed, contradictory or insufficiently conclusive to warrant an immediste ban and formal action was delayed, pending hear ings in late 1920, ‘David Gelber, the producer of the ""60 Minutes” Alar story and now the ecutive proce -for ABC's “Peer Jennings LIVING SCARED. Why Do the Media Make Life Seem So Risky? Second in a three-part series viewed by an estimated 40 million Americens—industry was al- ready moving away from Alar, and the nation's three major ‘baby-food makers said they were using non-Alsr apples. ‘The Natural Resources Defense Council, an activist en- vironmental group, wanted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to ban Alar and several other pesticides. When the ‘group produced a report (""Iatolerable Risk: Pesticides in Our Children’s Food"") condemning Alar, Newsweek rushed into print withthe story before the report was officially cleased, ‘The report, Newsweek said, would “almost certainly gen- crate frightening headlines.” Indeed it did—three weeks later, right after ""60 Minutes"" aired its story. News media throughout the country—effectively ‘manipulated by-the Natural Resources Defense Council and aid~ ced by public appeals and congressional testimony from that well-known molecular biologist Meryl Streep—almost made it seem that one bite of an Alar-reated apple or one swig of juice made from Alar-treated apples would mean instant deat, ‘Coverage of the Alar scare was “outrageous ... completely alarmist,"" says Marla Cone, who writes about the environment for the Los Angeles Times. But Alar Was a made-to-order media story. It had apples, ids and cancer. “A lot of (media) people were suckered in,” Cone says. Reporting,” says EPA and scientific criticism of Alar convinced ‘him the story was worth doing atthe time. Dr. John A. Moore, then acting administrator of the EPA, said on “60 Minutes” that Alar ""should come off the market” be- ‘cause of what he had earlier described as “an inescapable and direct correlation” between exposure to Alar and “the develop- ‘ment of life-threatening tumors."" The public had a right to know that was their view,"" Gelber says. Al Meyérhoff, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Fund, also defends the Alar story He says the apple industry launched a “concerted disinfor- ration campaign” in an effort to persuade the media and coasu- ‘mers alike that Alar was not dangerous. ‘The media have a ""tremendous problem,” Meyethoff says, {in uying to accurately and responsibly communicate risk. To be credible, they must avoid crying wolf too often. But to protect the public, they must also avoid what he calls ""crying sheep"" falling prey to timidity and self-censorship when they're criti- ized ‘There have been conflicting reports on Alar since the intial controversy.

The Tribune quoted MLBA Executive Director Jim Farrell as follows: Jeauary for annual dues for Miller Brewing Company. which Philip Morris owns. He said the company, probably to avert legal accusations afier some rough lawsuit losses, reported a portion of Miller's ‘association dues as Tobueco money because there's a chance some of that cash ‘could go to fight ‘anti tobacco efforts. “But in this case,’ Farrell said, “little of that money goes lobbying efforts regarding smoking, although he association's Web ste ‘pahudes articles and opinions against smoking bans. There is no conspiracy there. [just knew it as dues. When they report any money that goes into a state they do this,"" said. “I didn't hire a lobbyist for tobacco. This (dues) money came well before there was any discussion of any smoking ban.” Semttitcue Pera waco has as MD Mr. Farrell's explanation is troubling because the $2,500 payment was listed fon a legal document that Philip Mortis filed with the Minnesota Atoraey Cease, Office as a condition of its lawsuit setement with the State of Snnesota, Under te settlement agreement, bacco companics are requited wo ile quarterly sepons revealing ""payments to a lobbyist or principal, ifthe sefting defendant knows or has reason to know thatthe payment sl Bs used, direcly or indirectly, to influence legislative or administrative action, or the official action of state of local govemment in Minnesota in anyway relating (0 ‘Tobacco Products or their use."" nae “That Philip Mortis listed the payment to the Minnesota Licensed Beverage ‘Association in such a document makes it clear that this payment was meant 10 Poked for lobbying.

Approximately 27% of those with bloody diarthca were hospitalized, 89% developed systemic complications. and four children died (8). A common his- topathological finding in patients with postdiarrheal sequelae is the destruction of endothelial cclls lining small blood vessels in the colon, kidneys, and central nervous system (26). In vivo studies using a number of animal models demonstrated that purified Shiga toxin ancl SITs cause vascular damage in many of the samme target organs (for a review, see reference 9). In vitro studies utilizing human vascular endothelial cells (HVEC) from a numberof sites demonstrated a direct cytopathic effect ‘mediated by the toxins, although in Some cases, the toxin co- centrations necessary to manifest cytotoxicity were orders of ‘magnitude greater than that estimated to be circulating in the bloodstream of infected patients (23, 33). However, when HIVEC were cultured in the presence of the toxins and the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and interleukin If (IL-1B), cytotoxic doses were ‘markedly reduced, suggesting thatthe cytokines sensitized the target cells to the toxie action of SLTs (19, 3).

"25 Years of HNPCC Research on the genetic, molecular genetic, clinical features, and natural history of HNPCC has shown tremendous progress and evolution during the past 25 years. Specifically, HNPCC's autosomal dominant mode of genetic transmission has now been documented through linkage stu- dies of the gene at 2p (MSH2) and at 3p (MLE) with the cloning of these genes. Also, the tumor spectrum has in- creased, which now, in addition t0 carcinoma of the colon, endometrium, stomach, and ovary, includes transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter and renal pelvis, and adenocarcinomas * of the small bowel and pancreas. Surveillance and manage- ‘ment protocols for patients at high risk should include full colonoscopy since 70% of the colon cancers occur in the proximal colon. Because of the marked excess of synchronous ‘and metachronous colorectal cancers (CRC), no less than a sublotal colectomy should be performed at the time of ini CRC. Women, in addition to colonoscopy, require endomet- rial aspiration biospy. Should they develop CRC and if their ‘procreation is completed, we recommend that they consider prophylactic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo ‘oophoreciomy at the time of their sublotal colectomy. Now thatthe deleterious genes at 2p and 3p have been identified, we ‘are offering candidates, in whom the MSH2 or MLHI muta- tion has been verified, an option of prophylactic subiotal colectomy as opposed to annual lifetime colonoscopy.

The article, I believe, unfairly and inaccurately depicts smokers as undesirable employees with more illness and absenteeism than nonsmokers. For example, it is stated persons who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day have a ""50% greater rate"" of absenteeism than nonsmoking employees. This statement, a classic example of selective use of statistics, does little to inform corporate managers of the complexity of the issue of workplace smoking. . For example, omitted from the article are authoritative references which challenge the apparent basic premise of the article, 1.e., smoking causes increased employee absenteeism. If, as the claim purports, smoking is the cause of higher rates of absenteeism amcng smokers, one would expect to see consistently greater absentceism for all smokers than all nonsmokers. he following data demonstrate that this expectation, like the claim, oversimplifies the phenomenon of absenteeism: — Smokers. of fewer than 15 cigarettes per day have an absentceism rate of 2.6 days, compared to 4.3 days for person. who never smoked.

"AP v5022 ri 3exec Canada-cigarettes, Bit, 0694 01-29 8:37a Dilemma: Tax To Stop Smoking Or Cut Taxes To Stop Smuggling? AP Photo NY107 By JEFFREY ULBRICH Associated Press Writer TORONTO (AP) - Canada and its provinces levy 400 percent taxes on cigarettes trying to force people to stop smoking, but now they find the remedy to one problem has created another -’ smuggling. Contraband cigarettes account for as much as 75 percent of the market in Quebec and 40 percent in Ontario, the country’s two most populous provinces. That led to a retailers’ rebellion last week. Shopkeepers in Quebec banded together to defy the law by selling contraband cigarettes at cut-rate prices, first at St. Eustache, near Montreal, then at Sherbrooke. They openly sold smuggled cigarettes for 20 Canadian dollars ($15) a carton instead of the retail price of 48 Canadian dollars ($36). No charges have been filed against the merchants, who claim the smugglers are driving legitimate retailers out of business, and more such sales are planned. “The government has to take control of the black market and realize that our cause is justified and that they have to lower the tax,"" said Guy Belisle, a spokesman for retailers’ Movement to Abolish Cigarette Taxes. Prine Minister Jean Chretien seems to be listening. He told the House of Commons that negotiations are underway with the provinces to cut cigarette taxes. “We hope to have an agreement in the coming days,"" he said. ""If not, we will act in a unilateral fashion."" Solicitor General Herb Gray said the government is working on measures to combat the smuggling. Health organizations oppose any reduction in the taxes. Most of the cigarettes on the black market are made in Canada, exported legally to the United States, then smuggled back into Canada, frequently through the Mohawk Indian Reserve at Akwasasne, straddling the borders of New York, Quebec and Ontario. The Indians claim their aboriginal rights exempt them from paying or collecting taxes. Canadian tobacco companies - Imperial Tobacco, RJR-Macdonald and Rothman, Benson’ and Hedges - exported 17.4 billion cigarettes last year, and most went to the United States, according to Statistics Canada, Ottawa's official number cruncher. That is more than double the 1992 figure and five times more than 1990. Police estimate as much as 90 percent of those exports are smuggled back into Canada. ‘The cigarette companies deny they have any contact with smugglers but acknowledge the dramatic increase in exports is because of contraband. “We do not sell to smugglers directly,"" said Rob Parker, president of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Council. ""We sell to a very limited number of companies well known in the U.S. Obviously, three or four transactions later, the smugglers get their hands on this product and get it back’across the border."" Smugglers can obtain a carton of 200 Canadian cigarettes in the United states for 15 Canadian dollars ($11.25) and sell it here for 28 Canadian dollars ($21), making a profit while still undercutting the legal price of about 48 Canadian dollars ($36). “The industry has not caused smuggling,"" said Parker. “It is caused by the taxes and the huge profits that are available."" ‘The Canadian Medical Association has urged ottawa not to lower TI1674-1141",9

Gonzalez, Karl-Heinz Jockel, Martin Krauss, Lothar Kreienbrock, Michaela Kreuzer, Anabela Mendes, Franco Merlesti, Fredrik Nyberg, Goran Pershagen, Hermann Pohlabeln, Elio Riboli, Giovanni Schmid, Lorenzo Simonato, Jean Trédaniel, Elise Whitley, Heinz-Erich Wichmann, Carlos Winck, Paola Zambon, Rodolfo Saracci Background: An association between exposure to environ- ‘mental tobacco smoke (ETS) and tung cancer risk has been suggested. To evaluate this possible association better, re- searchers need more precise estimates of risk, the relative contribution of different sources of ETS, and the effect of| ETS exposure on different histologic types of lung cancer. To address these issues, we have conducted a case-control study of lung cancer and exposure to ETS in 12 centers from seven European countries. Methods: A total of 650 patients with Tung cancer and 1542 control subjects up to 74 years of age ‘were interviewed about exposure to ETS, Neither ease sub- Jects nor control subjects had smoked more than 400 ciga- rettes in ther lifetime, Results: ETS exposure during child- hhood was not associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (odds ratio [OR] for ever exposure = 0.78; 95% con- fidence interval [CT] = 0.64-0.96). The OR for ever exposure ‘0 spousal ETS was 1.16 (95% CI = 093-144). No clear ‘dose-response relationship could be demonstrated for cumu- lative spousal ETS exposure. The OR for ever exposure to workplace ETS was 1.17 (98% CI =0.94-145), with possible ‘evidence of increasing risk for inereasing duration of expo- sure. No increase in risk was detected in subjects whose ‘exposure to spousal or workplace ETS ended more than 15 ‘years earlier. Ever exposure to ETS from other sources was not associated with lung cancer risk. Risks from combined ‘exposure to spousal and workplace ETS were higher for ‘squamous cell carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma than for adenocarcinoma, but the differences were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Our results indicate no association between childhood exposure to ETS and lung cancer risk. We did find weak evidence of a dose-response relationship between risk of lung cancer and exposure to spousal and workplace ETS. There was no detectable risk after cessation of exposure. [J Natl Cancer Inst 1998;90:1440-0} During the last 15 years, epidemiologic studies have been ‘conducted on the association between exposure to envit 1440 ARTICLES tal tobacco stoke (ETS) and tung cancer. Several authors and regulatory agencies have concluded that causal link has been established (e.g. see (/~3)], whereas some authors consider that bias and confounding factors constitute a plausible explanation for the observed association (e.g, see 4]. The available studies ‘are—in most cases—too small to adequately assess the magni- tude of the effect and to address specific aspects, such as the shape of the dose-response relationship, the effect of cessation ‘of exposure, the importance of multiple sources of ETS expo- sure, nd the interaction of ETS exposure with other risk factors ‘of lung cancer. Furthermore, celatively few studies of such ex- posure are available from Europe (5-10). Characteristic of to- bacco smoking in European countries are the mixed consump: tion of blond and black tobacco cigereties (J/) and the low prevalence—at least in the past—of smoking among women ‘compared with men (12).

What we are talking about is a basic 2-4 minute boiler plate FET script with a voice over and a variety of visuals. To that will be added state specific comments by an economist, or Prof, Lilly on the Jobs at Risk study, and finally a comment from a local business group like the XYZ Merchants Council. ‘Total running time 5-6 min, This would then be released on the satillite wire and the stations will have the option of running parts of the story in their news casts, there will be no direct PM involvement, Tf we drop the VINR at the same time as a Press Conference by locals on this issue, we broaden the range of coverage in a state and inerease the chance it would be tun, ‘There is always the possibility that the story/VINR can be pitched before hand, or even ‘hard copied to the stations to increase use.

The Leptomonas collosoma Spliced Leader RNA Can Switch between Two Alternate Structural Formst Karen A. LeCuyer and Donald M. Crothers"" Department of Chemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06511 Received November 12, 1992; Revised Manuscript Received February 10, 1993 ApsTract: We have used a combination of physical and motecular biological techniques to examine the structure of Leptomonas collosoma spliced leader RNA. We confirm the general features of the previously proposed structure for the 3’ half of the RNA, in which a single-stranded region is flanked by two stem loops. However, we find that the 5’ half of the RNA, which contains the spice site, has two competing secondary structures which differ only slightly in stability and which can interconvert on a fast (<1 s) time scale, In the favored conformation, a stable hairpin helix is augmented by conserved complementarity between the splice site and the S’end ofthe SL RNA. This putative helix has anomalous nuclease sensitivity and thermal stability features, suggesting that itis probably coupled by unknown tert other nucleotides in the 5? half-molecule, The structure offers intriguing parallels with RNA-RNA. 5301 interactions in the mammalian splicing system. Pre-mRNA splicing sa processby which anintron sexcised and the exons are then ligated [reviews: Padgett etal. (1986); Maniatis and Reed (1987)]; intermediates in the cs splicing reaction have been well characterized. The trans splicing reaction of trypanosomes and nematod involves the transfer of a 5’ exon (22-41 nuclot froma short (<200 nucleotide) spliced leader transcript onto 4 preexisting mRNA (Konarska etal, 1985; Murphy eta, 1986; Sutton & Boothroyd, 1986). In trypanosomes all of themature mRNAs contain the spliced leader at their ends. A trans spliced leader is also found in a small pereentage of nematode mRNAs (Kraus & Hirsh, 1987; Blumenthal & ‘Thomas, 1988). ‘The proposed secondary structure for the kinetoplastid spliced leader (SL) RNAS (Bruzik et al, 1988) was based upon relative free energies predicted by the Fold program (Zuker, 1989) and upon conservation ofthe folding pattern for several SL RNAs. This structural conservation among the trypanosomatid SL RNAs is striking due tothe lack of length and sequence homology ouside ofthe spliced leader exon portion of the molecule, The proposed secondary structure contains three stem loops, the second and third of which flank a single-stranded region which has the sequence ofa binding ste for Sm proteins (Mattaj, 1988). The latter arecommon splicing proteins that areimmunoprecipitable by antibodies found in the serum of certain autoimmune patients (Lemer & Stcitz, 1979). In vitro assembly of SL RNA snRNPs with HeLa cell Sm proteins, followed by immuno- precipitation with anti-Sm antibodies (Bruzik eta, 1988), shows that the putative Sm protein binding site of the SL RNAsisactiveinproteia binding. U! independenceof splicing the trans spliced leader to an adenovirus exon in cis has also been demonstrated using Ul-depleted HeLa cell extracts (Bruzik & Steitz, 1990). This result led to the proposal that {he functional domain for 5 splice site identification in trans splicing resides in the SL sa RNP itself and not ina UI RNA sa RNP.

(0006-2960/93/0432-5301804.00/0 © 1993 American Cher Ourstrategy for investigating the structure of the SL RNA. begins with tests ofthe global features of the proposed model (Bruzik et al, 1988), primarily by determining the stability and binding kinetics of DNA oligonucleotides hybridized to the putatively single-stranded regions which ae predicted by the model. This approach yielded the predicted results for the 3 but not the 5’ half of the molecule. We also examined the thermal unfolding equilibria and kinetics for the molecule, ‘using the temperature-jump (T-jump) technique, in which ‘thesampleis rapidly heated and the optical changeis measured asa function of time. We found a low-temperature thermal transition which could not be accounted for by unfolding of Ihelies in the model of Bruzik et al. (1988), Subsequent experiments localized this effect to the 5’half of the molecule. We then employed mutagenesis and polyacrylamide gel clectrophoresis methods such as ribonuclease mapping (Douth- waite & Garrett, 1981; Celander & Cech, 1990) and base rmodification/interference experiments (Peattie, 1979; Conway & Wickens, 1989; Weeks et al., 1990) to probe the structure ofthe S‘halfof LeptomonascollosomaSLRNA. We propose anew structure in which a stable hairpin helix is augumented by pairing of the 5’ end of the SL RNA with the spice site. ‘The hairpin helix has a measured Ty about 6 °C higher than the analogous helix proposed by Broziketal. (1988). However, the putative splice site helix bas unusual properties, including ‘anomalously small thermal stability changes upon mutation, single-strand nuclease sensitivity a the splicesite,and apparent tertiary interactions with additional nucteotides in the 5"" half of the SLRNA. We speculate that the internal spice site pairing may be analogous to pairing ofthe 5’ end of Ul with the 5’ splice site in mammalian pre-mRNA splicing (Zhuang & Weiner, 1986), MATERIALS AND METHODS DNA Oligonucleotides. All DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized onan Applied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer. Oligonucleotides <15 bases ong were dialyzed into the buffer used for temperature-jump experiments. Oligonucleotides > 1S bases long were purified on 10-15% denaturing poly- ‘acrylamide gels.

Numer- ‘ous mechanisms (2, 3] have been proposed, including anorexia and malabsorption (both tumor-related and iatrogenic), and derange- ments of host metabolism. Modern methods of hyperalimentation have not succeeded in reversing cancer cachexia despite the achieve- ment of high parenteral caloric intake [4], leaving one to conclude that altered host me- tabolism is important in the pathogenesis of this malnourished state.

"lation of the entire United States, reports that only 14 per cent of regular elgarctte smokers state that they consider the habje pleasurable, safe, and worth the cost, Why do smokers not give up the habit that so many-state they would like (o shed? Despite pronouncements from health authorities in all parts of the world, the proportion of smokers reporting suceessful discontinuation of smoking is from 10 to 20 per cent in mates and 3 to 10 per cent in femates (Hacnszel et al. 1956, P. 24; Hammond & Perey 1958, p. 2,956; Cart wright et al, 1959, p. 726; and Horn 1963, p. 391). Immediately following the 1964 report of the surgeon general of the United States, 8.6 per cent of the smoking students at two U.S. colleges xe- ported that they stopped smoking as a result of the health hazard identified in this report (Katahn et al. 1964). Again, a greater percentage of male smokers (10.3 per cent) than female smokers (5.9 Per cent) reported quitting. In addition, more nat- ural science majors (18.2 per cent) quit smoking than did liberal arts majors (6.7 per cent). The same students took a story-compietion test requi ing them to create both an imaginary story and an estimate of the amount of time which in reality would have transpired during the occurrence of the sequence of events in the story. Ex-smokers tended to respond with a longer time perspective than did students who continued to smoke, and the authors suggest that these individuals might be more likely {0 worry about long-term health hazards, Immediately before and following the surgeon general's report, several researchers atiempted to find effective means for discourag-ng initiation and encouraging cessation of the smoking habit. Horn (1960) used a variety of educa:ional approaches. with high school students in Pordand, Oregon, but he reported oxty minimal success ‘i: preventing the {initiation of smoking. Both Horn (1664, personal ‘communication ) and Lawden (1965. personal com- munleation) have attempted to help adult smokers discontinue smoking through the use of weekly educational meetings (Horn fn Washington) and weekly “group therapy” sessions (Lawton in Phil- adelphia). With both techniques, success rates were not much higher than the 10 to 20 per cent “spontaneous” successes reported by other writers. The Horn and Lawton studies raise an important question for all cessation studies: who is an ex- smoker? Is he an individual who quits for a week, a month, a year, oF fotever? It fs both a common observation and an established statistical fact that SMOKING 339 many ex-smokers resume the habit after varying, 1. After reviewing, the above liter: the present withors have concluded that, in all probability, people begin t» smoke for essentially the same reasons that they adopt other habits. such as eating certain foods, using certain brands of soap. wearing lipstick, joing to sec the Beatles, and so forth, That is, initiation of smoking appesrs to be a result of the millions of dottars spent yearly by (cigarette) manufacturers to influence people 0 do 80; the standards and fads extant in youthful and adult social circles; the examples provided by parents and families; the depth of cormmitment to. personal religious codes; and, finally, some paycho- logical and personality characteristics (e.g., extra- version, tension, neuroticism, etc.) of the indi- Vidual himself, In our opinion, the last category (personality characteristics) is the least influential in determining whether a given individual will hegin to smoke, whereas the other factors Cespectally the amount spent on world-wide advertising) have con- sideri-s» influence. Once started, however, contin- ‘uation or discontinuation appears to be, in large part, a function of the sociopsychological charac. teristics of the individual. Joszpn D. MATARAzz0 AND RUTH G.

ELEM? axo R LOVE Department of Pathology, Thomas efereon University, Philadelphi, Pennayteanta 19107 ABSTRACT Cultures of human diploid fibroblasts (HDF) exhibiting density dependent inhibition of replication (DDIR) resumed thelr progression through the cell cycle following medium replacement and, after a lag period of two hours, showed a dramatic increase in the incidence of isonucleolinar* cells and in the levels of uptake of *H-uridine into the nucleoli. Between five and ten hours after refeeding these nucleolar changes wore maximal, leveling off at the highest val- ues, in periods corresponding to late G1 and ealy §. Concomitantly, a parallel ‘merease in the number of nucleolin per cell occurred, As cells progressed through 8 and G2 phases the nucleolin! decreased in nimber and reverted to the aniso- ‘nucleolinar type. The intensity of nucleolar labeling by “H-uridine and lts corre. Inte, the frequency of cells with labeled nucleoli, also decreased ducing these cell ceyele stages. Both pre- and postreplicative periods of mitotic quiescence were characterized by high levels of anisonucleolinosis (60-80% of the cells) and by very low levels of nucleolar +H-uridine incorporation, ‘The magnitude of these nucleolar changes occurring during G1 stage was found (o be strongly dependent on: (1) the length of time of contact between the cells and the fresh medium, at least eight hours of contact being necessary for ‘maximal response; (2) the amount of serum in the medium, the optimal serum concentration being between 10 and $0%, and (3) the pH of the medium. The nucleolar response was completely abolished at pH values below 7.0, These nucle. lar changes were very sensitive t the presence of cycloheximide (10 nglml) fand actinomycin D (0.003 gil), The behavior of the nucleoli in response to these parameters was similar t the activation response of the cells to inidate DNA synthesis. During the time period of maximal nucleolar “activation” the onset of DNA ‘synthesis as well a3 the morphological and autoradiographic manifestations of the nucleolar activation were completely inhibited by vary low levels of actino- ‘myein D (Ellem and Mironescu, ""72, a selective inhibitor of nucleolar RNA syn. thests (Perzy, 65). This suggested a possible role of nucleolar metabolism, in nor ‘mal diploid cells, inthe initiation of DNA synthesis. Our results, however, seera to indicate that the nucleolar changes are necessary but not suifcient for the ‘subsequent initiation of DNA synthesis, since with graded serum concentrations ‘or medium volumes, smaller levels of a stimulus were needed to produce maximal -isonucleolinosis than to effect a maximum replicative response in the celle. Recent results indicate that, in the ab- sence of any medium change, replication of some human (Rhode and Ellem, ’68) or ro- dent (Todaro et al.,'65) cell lines on a solid substrate in vitro’ ccases when a critical cellular density is, reached (density de- ‘pendent inhibition of replication — DDIR). Celis can be roleased from DDIR by the addition of fresh medium or by addition of certain small molecular woight nutrients J Cent Pavston, 82: 438-400, to the depleted medium (Smets, ""71; Ellem and Mironescu, '73). Usually, in cells ex- hibiting DDIR, synthesis of ribosomal RNA (Levine et al., ""65; Rhode and Ellem, '68) 4s greatly reduced or virtually ceases, and the cells are blocked at the GI level (Nil- hausen and Green, '65), Addition of fresh complete medium (Rhode and Ellem, '68) Teceved Feb. 27,78, Aocopied July 18°73, See toomotes tap 2 445 50219599",6

Clonogenic progenitor cell assays of cells from the bone marrow and spleens of these Infected mice suggest that EPO-R(R129C) can stimulate proliferation ‘of committed megakaryocytic and erythroid progenitors as well as nonerythroid multipotent progenitors. From the spleens of SFFVCEPO-R-infected mice, eight multiphenotypic immortal cell lines were isolated at characterized, These included primitive erythroid, lymphoid, and monocytic cells. Some expressed prote ‘characteristic of more than one lineage. All cell lines resulting from SFFVcEPO-R infection contained a mutant form of the p53 gene. However, in contrast to infection by SFFV, activation of PUL gene expression, by retroviral integration, was not observed. One cell line bad integrated a provirus upstream of the fi-? gene, in 1 location typically seen in erythroleukemic cells generated by Friend murine leukemia virus infection. This event led to increased expression of fi-I in this cell line. Thus, infection by SFFVcEPO-R can induce proliferation and lead to transformation of nonerythroid as well as very immature erythroid progenitor eels. ‘The sites of proviral integration ia clonal cell lines are distinct from those in SFFV-derived lines. Hematopoietic cell proliferation and diferentiation are large part controlled by several growth factors that transduce proliferation andior differentiation signals through specific cell Surface receptors (38). The majority of hematopoictic growth factors utlze receptors that are members of the etokine oF hhematopoietin receptor superfamily, including receptors for cexythropoietin (EPO), granuloeyte-macrophage (GM) colony- stimulating factor, granulocyte-stimolatory factor, and inter leukin2 (IL-2), 1.3, IL-4, IL, IL-4, and IL7 (4, 13). The tosolic domains of these receptors are dissimilar, and none contains any known enzymatic activity. These receptors are ‘thought to signal by activating cytosolic enzymes, in particular ‘one or more protein kinases (39). Specifically the EPO recep- tor (EPO-R) has been shown to complex with and activate the cytosolic tyrosine kinase JAK2, which is widely expressed in different hematopoietic progenitor cells (63). Expression of recombinant EPO-R in normally IL-3-dependent cell lines allows them to grow in either IL3 or EPO (33, 39). If a constitutively activated form of the EPO-R, EPO-R(RI29), i expressed in these same cells, neither IL-3 nor EPO is required to sustain proliferation (34). These observations suggest that at least some common intracellular sigals are generated by the receptors for IL-3 and EPO. However, expression of EPO- R(R129C) in ftal iver erythroid progenitors can replace the EPO requirement but not the IL-S or stem cell factor (SCF) requitement for diferentiation of GM and erythroid burst forming unit (BFU-E) progenitors (51). Thus, we do not know the foll extent to which signals generated by the various ‘ojtokine receptors overlap. TEPO is thought to act on relatively late, coms sd, ery ‘~TGorresponding author.

Leukemia can be regarded as a multistage disease process, involving multiple genetic abnormalities affecting <ifering pathways controling cell proliferation andior diferentiation (62). Because the celular hallmarks of leukemia are dysrego- lated proliferation and differentiation, the role of growth factors and their receptors in the leukemic process has been the focus of a great deal of investigation. Constitutive (ys regulated) overexpression of hematopoietic growth factors (EPO, GM colony-stimulatng factor, and IL-3) in mice results in mycloprolferaive disorders, not leukemia (12, 4, 27, 57). (On the other hand, activating mutations in some hematopot- tic growth factor receptors (colony-stimulating factor 1 recep- tor (CSF-1R}, EPO-R) have, in experimental murine models, Jed tothe development of leukemia in a multistep process (20, 34). Specifically, the EPO-R has been implicated in two modes ‘of leukemia induction. Friend virus is an acutely transforming murine erythroleu- emia retrovirus. A replication-defective spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) and a replication-competent Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MULV) comprise the Friend virus complex.

"Journal of Neuroscience Research Molecular Cloning and Expression of a 5-Opioid Receptor From Rat Brain M.E, Abood, M.A. Noel, J.S. Farnsworth, and Q. Tao Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond We have isolated and characterized a rat 8-opiold receptor. The deduced amino acid sequence (372 12) closely resembles the murine 8-opioid receptor, DOR-1. In fact, 97% of the amino acid residues are conserved between the two species, while 93% of the nucleic acid residues are identical. A 6 kb mRNA was detected in rat cortex using rat DOR-1 as a probe. ‘When expressed in COS cells, the clone shows high- affinity opioid binding with selectivity for 8-opioids. ‘The rat 8-opioid receptor cDNA clone will be a useful tool for studying the function of 8-oploid receptor in Fats, © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Key words: rat, @DNA-brain, DOR-1 INTRODUCTION While well defined pharmacologically, the opioid receptors have until recently been refractory to molecular cloning. Opioid receptors have been classified into three ‘groups, delta (6), mu (1), and kappa (x) (Lord et al., 1977; Martin ct al., 1976; Goldstein et al., 1971; Simon et al., 1973; Pert and Snyder, 1973; Terenius, 1973). ‘The B-opioid receptor is selective for the endogenous opioid peptides met- and leu-enkephalin and for several synthetic peptides (Lord et al., 1977; Mosberg et al., 1983). Its distribution in the central nervous system has been mapped using receptor autoradiography; itis most dense in olfactory-related areas, cortex, caudate puta- ‘men, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala (Mansour et al., 1987). The B-receptor is also found peripherally in the ‘mouse vas deferens (Lord et a. 197). In addition, the B-opivid receptor is found on many neurally derived cell lines, including NG1O8-15 mouse neuroblastoma X rat glioma hybrid cells (Sharma et al., 1975), SK-N-SH cells (Yu et al., 1986), and PCI2h rat pheochromocy- toma cells (Inowe and Hatanaka, 1982; Abood and Eu- banks, 1993). ‘The murine 8-opioid receptor has recently been cloned using expression techniques and shown to be a ‘member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family (Evans etal., 1992; Kiefler ct al., 1992). The cloned receptor is a mouse cDNA clone isolated from the mouse neuroblas- © 1994 wa toma-rat glioma hybrid cell line NG108-15. We, along with many others, have been studying the function of B-opioid receptors in rats. The mouse clone can be used to detect B-opioid receptor mRNA in mouse and rat tis sues by Northern blot hybridization; however, there are some difficulties with using the mouse clone to detect S-receptor mRNA in other rodent species. In particular, anatomical localization by in situ hybridization in rat brain has not yet been demonstrated with the murine S-receptor clone. The goal of this study was to clone the rat homolog of the 8-opioid receptor. While this manu- script was under revision, a paper describing the cloning of a S-opioid receptor from Wistar rats was reported by Fukuda et al. (1993). The clones will be useful tools for studying the function of B-opioid receptors in rats.

The library was sereened with a random- primed probe prepared from the coding region of DOR-1 (kindly provided by Dr. Chris Evans, UCLA) which was labeled to a specific activity >5 x’ 10 dpmvug (Sam- brook et al.. 1989). The first screen was at moderate stringency, $5°C overnight in 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, and 100 jugim! denatured salmon sperm DNA. The filters (NEN colony sereen plus, Boston, MA) were then washed to a final stringeney of 2X SSC, 1% SDS, 55°C. Out of 1 x 10° ROB plaques screened, one positive partial clone was obtained, 14C1, This clone was used to screen the library at high stringency (60°C hybridization and 65°C washes in 0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS) to isolate a clone, 19A1, HODS Received August 9, 1993: revised and avepted Seplemter 16, 1993, Addcess reprint requests to Mary E.

In a series of controlled exposure studies we investigated the occurrence and degree of acute cffests of shor-ierm passive smoking in adults and children with asthma. Taroughout allstudies we ‘used 2 constant cigarene smoke conceatration of 20:ppm carbon monoxide. In dhe first study 24 adult patients witheild bronchial asthma and 16 healthy subjects were enrolled. ‘Subjecs breathed cigazene smoke or room air while siting at ret for one hour. Lang function was measured before and after exposure, and: airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine was determined within one hour after exposure. As compared to room air, lung function parameters did rot change significantly and airway responsiveness was pot altered after passive smoking, [AS it seemed reasonable to expect a more pronounced airway response to air pollutants in children than in adults, we then studied 11 ehiléren with mild bronchial asthma while using ap analogous experimental protocol. However, similarly as seen in the adults, lung function and airway respoasive- ‘nets to inhaled histamine were not affecied by ope hot: of passive smoking in these children, ‘The next srudy was designed to investigate the effets of cigarette smoke during vs after exposure and to compare the effects observed at renting ventilation with those observed at increased! ventilation rate. Thirteen children with exercise-induced asthma participated in this study. Tey breathed either Cigarene smoke or room air for one bour and exercised on a bicycle ergometer during the last six minvies of exposure, Mean forced:expiratory volume in one second, as a measure of lung function, decreased by about 5% during passive smoking as. compared to room air. This effect could be lanribuied to tyes sooke-senstive children and disappeared during and after exercise testing, Most patients with bronchial asthma sbow an inerease in symptoms, an impairment of lung functioa and an enhancement of airway responsiveness during night compared to daytime. Tus, in 2 further study we investigated the effects of passive smoking in the evening on the course of hung function lind airway responsiveness until the next morning. Seventeen subjects with mild bronchial asthma ere exposed to cigarene smoke or room air for Ure hours al rest, On the average, lung function ‘did not change duting passive smoking but demonstrated small impairments at 3.00-a.m. in the right and 07.00 a.m. inthe next morning. Similarly, airway responsiveness to methacholine showed 2 tendency towards increased valves at these times. From these studies we conclude that individual patients with asthma can sbow a temporary impair- ment of long function during or several hours after passive smoking. It is noteworthy that itis, Gifficat to detect smoke-sensitive subjects reliably, since there is no obvious correlation beween measured changes of functional parameters and acute or anamnestic sympioms due 10 passive smoking, es6otsezon",6

The only known factors were some results (rom buervaions and putf profile recordings of smokers (Keith and Hackney. 1962) which may have influenced machine smoking conditions. 'At about the same time measurements and observations were made to determine differences ln smoke deliveries between free smoking’ or natural smoking, and ‘restrleted smoking’ or machine smoking. Additionally ideas were put forward to estimate smoke intake by analysing the amount of smoke cetained in the tobacco butt and on the fter tip. ‘There were also first thoughts and proposals for the reproduction of hurman smoking by means ofa ‘slavemoker’ or “puff duplicator, ‘Our ideas stemmed from the observation that the range of human smoking behaviour i very wide and we would have to study many subjects. Experimental imethods should be chosen or developed which would allow us to drew conclusions about the behaviour of the average smoker. (Of all methods availabe, we thought that the examination of cigarette butts discarded by smokers would be most successful. This was the only totally non invasive way fo estimate the amounts of smoke taken by human smokers, and tuch ‘cigarette butts are available in large enough samples to answer many questions. ‘The butt analysis KIPA’ (Crom Kippen.a slang term for cigarette end) is limited to filter cigarettes. which formed approximately 85% of the cigarette consumption in Germany. ‘The basis of KIPA isthe correlation ofthe amount of smoke retained in the filter with the actual amount of smoke taken in by the smoker. Under constant ‘smoking conditions (puff volume and puff duration, whichis equivalent to constant flow rate) the ratio between the amount of smoke retained in the fer and the factual intake of smoke is constant.

Dr. Ford has accepted our invitation to attend the symposium, and suggested that we contact you regarding support for the conference. We are enclosing infomation outlining the specific aims of this important and timely ‘symposium. ‘The four-day conference will be held April 14-18, 1982, in nicago, Tllinois. ‘he primary objective of ‘this meeting will be to define and focus on the questions that need to be answered in order to understand both normal and pathological states in the production of respiratory movenent, and in the regulation of respiration in humans. ‘This topic is of findanental interest to both the basic scientist, who investigates the production of movenent and/or respiratory control, and the clinician, who mist diagnose, treat and/or prevent diseases as Sleep Apnea, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, Cheyne-Stokes Respiration, Cndine's Curse Syndrome and otiner disorders related to the production of periodic respiratory movenents; these diseases om affect Individuals of any age, race and sex. We have enclosed a preliminary description of the meeting. All participants are world-relmoin authorities and are drain fran the United States, Cmada, Eastem and Western Burope, and Japan. ‘The National. Institutes of Health will fund a fraction of the conference expenses. We have reviewed the anticipated budget and find that a minimm of an additional $1 is required to cover stipends to ‘support the transportation (overseas and danestic airfare) and lodging of leading investigators who should attend the conference. We have been secking these necessary additional finds from one or more non-govermental. sources, and therefore greatly appreciated your letter of interest. ‘The fact that The Council for ‘Tobacco Research has contributed to this important symposium wuld be made frown to the solentific camuity through an announcanent at the meeting as well as in writing in the published proceedings.

"7-— WHICH SIDE ARE YOU ON? Should Teenagers Start Smoking? To smoke or not to smoke? That’s the question many people are asking themselves these days. They know it might be a matter of life and death to them. And it's no secret that some of these people aren't any older than you. Our information for the “No” side was obtained by interviewing a man who quit smoking three years ago after puffing two packs a day for 15 years. We couldn't think of any arguments for the “Yes” side. Can you? Which side are you on? ""The fun and pleasure of ‘not smoking far outweigh the pleasure of two packs @ day. The non-smoker enjoys food so much more. He has more en- ergy to do things that are much more satisfying than puffing a weed. He sleeps more soundly. ‘He usually doesn’t catch as many ‘colds. He doesn’t get winded as easily and so can do better in sports, Usually he doesn’t annoy himself and others with a rasp- ing cough. In the. morning his mouth does not taste like the in- side of an old pair of gloves. He is calmer, more poised, more con- fident than many smokers. ‘The non-smoker saves money —as much as $200 a year! ‘And don’t forget that a mere two or three cigarettes a day fre- quently lead to two or three packs a day. ‘But there is a much more ser- ious reason for not smoking cig- arettes. ‘They can kill you. No victim of the stabbing pain of lung cancer would be likely to advise you to smoke, The smoker ‘also has more reason to fear heart attacks and diseases that attack the lungs such as bron- chitis and emphysema. The death rate for men who began smok- ing when they were teenagers is 100 percent higher than that of non-smokers. °As a non-smoker you can hope for a longer life filled with the real pleasures of not smoking. ‘And your growing confidence and poise will spring, not from ‘the flimsy crutch of nicotine, but from you. @ YOUNG caTHoL. messencen DAYTON, OHIO we 808,300 MAR4 1365 TIMN 280272",9

"Dual Effect of Nitrogen Dioxide on Rat Alveolar Macrophage Arachidonate Metabolism Timothy W. Robison and Henry Jay Forman ABSTRACT: Significant deficits in alveolar macrophage (AM) function have been associated ‘with acute exposure t0 nitrogen dioxide (NOs. The present incestigation examined changes in enzymatic production of arachidonate metabolites from rat AM exposed to NO, While in vitro exposure of AM to NO; concentrations becween 0.1 and 5 ppm alone hed small effets on basal synthesis of cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase products ‘exposure to either 1 ppm (2 or 4b) or 5 ppm (1b) markedly enhanced the sponse of AM to stimulation by the calcium ionophore, A23187. This preexpesure led to significant increases in eyclooxygenase products (thromboxane B, thromboxane), the stable metabo- lite of thromboxane Ay and 12bydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (12HHT) and lipo ‘genase products (leukotriene B (LTB) and monokydroxyeicosetetraenoate isomers) in response to A23187. In contrast, « 1b exposure to 20 ppm NO; alone significantly increased AM synthesis of thromboxane and 12-HHT, but suppresed the effect of subse quently added A23187, Increased synthesis of cyclooxygenase products with 20 ppm NO, alone were blocked with the phospholipase inhibitor mepacrine and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. Toe lipoxygenase inhibitor nordibydroguaiaretc acid (NDGA) significantly reduced release of arachidonate: however, levels of thromboxane and 12- HHT were significantly increased. The results suggest a dual effect of NO, on AM arachidonate metabolism in zwhich low concentrations of NO, had small effects on basal metabolism but markedly amplified the response to stimuli while a high concentration ‘of NO; did the reverse. Such a complex dose-response effect may have significant impact in explaining the pathlogic effets of NO, INTRODUCTION Nitrogen dioxide (NO)) is a reactive gas formed by combustion processes, ‘most notably those that produce tobacco smoke, home gas stove emissions, From the Cal Biclogy Group, Departmen of Peisrss and Patol and Isitute for Toxicology Unive of Suter Californie, and Chives Hopital of Los Angle, Los Angeles, CA 9027 ‘Adives corropondene 1 Timothy W.

Barrington General Counsel Philip Morris, Inc. 120 Park Avenue New York, NY 10017-5592 Re: Freekick, Major League Soccer Dear Mr. Barrington: Pursuant to our telephone conversation of May 6, [ enclose a capy of Freekick, which is the official program for Major League Soccer. As we are lead to believe, the four pages of glossy print on the front and the four pages of glossy print at the end are generated at the national level and provided to each of the teams. The teams thereafter insert their local information. Based on what we have been told locally, and indeed what appears within the joumal itself, the local information is reprinted four times throughout the year. It seems that the front cover is changed weekly. Please note the Marlboro ad on the inside of the front cover spanning over into the third page. The Attomeys General have a significant concer that such advertisement is contrary to the letter and the spirit of Philip Morris’ agreement not to target youth. As I am sure you know, of all the major sports with professional teams, soccer has a particular connection with youth athletes in America today. It is our hope that we can quickly discuss this matter in that Major League Soccer season is already underway. We in Columbus, Ohio, have a particular concern since we are in the midst of constructing the nation’s first soccer only stadium. The inaugural game in that stadium will be on May 15 and the soccer world will be in Columbus for that event, We are hopeful that prior to that game, progress can be made in a cooperative fashion toward resolving what we believe to be a violation of the MSA. ‘We would also be appreciative if you could forward to us pertinent information. For instance, we would like to see a copy of the contract between Philip Morris and ISP, the publishing company that produces the program.

Subcommittee members are invited to attend the Central Committee so that they can leam more about the overall objectives. I have attached a document that describes the functions of the subcommittee. This description is for your review and can be modified at the groups discretion. ‘As our first item of business we need to look at lnb chemical disposal at BGTC. The intent of ths effort is to minimize the amount of lab chemicals that are sent to the stock room for commercial disposal. Commercial disposal is expensive and should be utilize only when there is not a more cost effective option available. Disposal options must be safe and comply with environmental regulations. Reduction can be achieved if lab personne! are better informed on the disposal options that are available for managing waste chemicals. T have attached a document (LAB CHEMICAL WASTE DISPOSAL GUIDELINES) for your review. The group needs to determine if these guidelines are workable and make changes as necessary. The approved guidelines can then be referred to the Rules and Procedures Subcommittee who will be responsible for implementation. ‘We will meet monthly and members should try to send someone to represent their area when they can not attend. etze Tetzs",0

(4S-C34(S) These studies demonstrate that reeal cortical homogenate and RBC cAMP concentrations are increased in chronic renal failure animals. Ia the same animals relative ionic chloride permeability (PCUPK) was significantly increased in renal corteal BEM and RBC ghosts. PNuPK was not affected, This selective change in permeability results ima significant increase in PCUPNa and hyperpoarization of BBMY of sufficient magnitude to stimulate Na""-lependent glutamine transport.

[1-3] in various epithelia such as kidney (1, 4, S}, trachea (6, 7), gallbladder (3, 8], and shark rectal gland (2]. This messenger has also been reported to ‘modulate ionic chloride permeability in some non-polarized cells, the normal human red blood cell [9] and the cultured lymphocyte [10]. While these observations were made during pharmacologic manipulations that acutely elevated intracellular ‘CAMP concentrations, similar changes have also been detected, in membranes of cells in which cAMP is endogenously and chronically increased: relative ionic chloride permeability of Received for publication November 18, 1991, and in revised form March 13, 1972 ‘Accepted for publication March 16, 1952 © 1992 by the International Society of Nephrology RBC ghosts and RBC cAMP concentrations are both increased in untreated uremic humans; after treatment with peritoneal dialysis both are indistinguishable from those in normal vol teers [9]. Based on the fact that renal failure is aecompanied by clevated plasma concentrations of several hormones that act vate adenylate cyclase (PTH, norepinephrine, glucagon, and ADH) [1-13], it was postulated that an increase in relative ionic chloride permeability might not be confined to the red cell, but rather might represent a more global change in membrane permeability in chronic renal failure. Since intracellular chio- Fide activity is at or above electrochemical equilibrium in diverse issues [1, 7, 8, 14, 1S], a selective increase in rel ionic chloride permeability would depolarize cells (1, 3, 5]. If such were the case, the resultant perturbations in cell function (thats, transport and electrical signaling) could be responsible, at least in part, for a number of systemic manifestations of renal failure. ‘The present studies were designed to determine whether an increase in membrane ionic chloride permeability is confined 10 human red cell membranes or whether such an increase occurs. in other cells in renal fulure, The 75% nephrectomized rat was. used as a model of renal failure. These studies demonstrate that renal failure in the rat is accompanied by increases in renal cortical cAMP concentration and relative ionic chloride perme ability of renal cortical brush border membranes. Of note, these changes were not confined to renal cortical membranes. As io, the human {9}, red blood cell cAMP concentrations and the ‘onic chioride permeability of RBC membranes were signfi- cantly increased in renal failure in the rat. The demonstration of qualitatively similar findings in membranes of both potarized and non-polarized cells suggests that membrane ionic perme- ability may be significantly altered in a number of tissues in renal failure in association with hormonally induced increases in intracellular concentrations of cAMP. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into sham operated, luninephrectomized and 75% nephrectomized groups. All ani- ‘mals were anesthetized by an intraperitoncal injection of pen- tobarbital 45 mpke body wt (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Missouri, USA). Thereafter, kidneys were exposed by blunt dissection via bilateral fank incisions.

NADPH oxidation was a linear function of the concentration of microsomes in the absence of vanadate, but was a saturating function in the presence of vanadate. Micro: Somes did not catalyze 2 vanadate-atimulated oxidation of reduced nicotinamide mono- nucleotide (NMNH), but gained this ability when NADPH was also present. When the Concentration of NMNH was much greater than that of NADPH 9 minimal average Chain length could be calculated from ¥, the ratio of NMNH oxidized per NADPH added. ‘The term chain length, as used here, signifies the number of molecules of NMNH oxidized per initiating event. Chain length could be increased by increasing [vanadate] and [NMNH) and by decreasing pH. Chain lengths in excess of 30 could ensity be achieved. ‘The K.. for NADPH, arrived at from saturation of its ability to trigger NMNH oxidation by microsomes in the presence of vanadate, was 1.5 um.

"An Automated Steam Distillation-Ultra Violet Absorption Method for the Determination of Nicotine Alkaloids in Tobacco and Smoke ‘CORA W.AYERS Introd ‘An automated procedure for the determination of nicotine alkaloids in tobacco and smoke is most desirable for a laboratory concerned with the rou- tine analysis of commercial tobaccos and cigarettes. ‘The official, non-automated AOAC method (1), which is used in most laboratories concerned with the analysis of tobacco products, is precise and ac- curate; it mcorporates a steam distillation process to isolate the nicotine alkaloids followed by an ul- traviolet spectrophotometric assay. Automated methods (2, 3) have been developed for the deter- tion of nicotine alkaloids in tobacco, but these Ail javolve a colorimetric assay based on the react- Figure 7 Precenlea at the European Technicon Symposium, >Auiomauon in Analytical Chemistry, Paris, France, Nov 2,3, 4, 1966, by Cora W. Ayers, Research and Deveiopment Establishment, Britsh-American Tobacco Co. Lid, Southampton, England. 107 jon of nicotine with cyanogen bromide and this co Tour reaction is not as sensitive as the ultra-violet absorption measurement. In addition, in these pu Diished methods (3) the analyses are made on an aqucous extract of tobacco, without the preliminary steam distillation whichallows the nicotine alkaloids to_be isolated and freed from mostof the interfering substances. Whilst the steam distillation stage is not essential for some tobaccos, itis needed with to- bbaceos of low sugars contents and with all smoke solutions. It appeared worthwhile therefore, to de- velop an automated method, which is generally app- Ticable to both smoke and tobacco; such a method should incorporate a steam distillation to isolate the nicotine alkaloids, followed by an ultra-violet spec- trophotometric measurement. Apparatus A standard Technicon Sampler II and Proport- foning Pump are used. These are linked to a spe- cially designed steam distilation unit and to a Beckman DB spectrophotometer equipped with Alow-through cells which were also specially desig ned, ‘Steam Disilation Unit ‘The steam distillation unit consists of three main sections (Figure 1):— (1) a preheater; @) a heating unit; ) a distilation unit. ‘The preheater isa straight length of glass tubing, 2 ft in length and 3/16 in (48 mm) O.D., and is connected to the heating unit by a glass U piece.

However, upon discussing the application of 0-150 to products for actual consumer mailout with Dr Appleton, che decision was made to include a twenty fold safety factor when calculating the acceptable daily exposure level in order to ensure complete smoker safety (see Actachment 2).

M 1 Unit, Edinburgh inburgh E10 SHE British Journal of Psychiatry (1989), 184, 797-800 The Effects of Nicotine on Attention, Information Processing, and Short-Term Memory in Patients with Dementia of the Alzheimer Type BARBARA SAHAKIAN, GEMMA JONES, RAYMOND LEVY, JEFFREY GRAY and DAVID WARBURTON Nicotin Of attention and information prot to dotect a flickering ight in a in pationts with dementia of tho Alzheimer type (DAT) producted a significant and ‘marked improvement in diacriminstve senaitvty and resction times on somputorisod tost Improved the ability of OAT patients . These results suggest that nicotine ‘may be acting on cortical mechanisms involved in veual perception and atterton, and support {he hypothesis that acetycholine transmission modulates viglance and discrimination, Nicotine ‘may therefore be of some value in treating deficits in attention and information processing in DAT patients ‘The cholinergic hypothesis of ageing and dementia attributes impairment of memory and cognition to ‘reduced central cholinergic function (Drachman & Sahakian, 1979; Bartus er ai, 1982; Sahakian, 1988). Critical evidence for this hypothesis isthe finding thatthe degree of cognitive impairment in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) is positively correlated with decrease of choline acetyltransferase, and a reduction in acetylcholine (ACH) syathess in brain, measured in post-mortem and biopsy studies respectively (Perry et al, 1978; Francis eta, 1985). In addition, both muscarinic and nicotine receptors in cerebral cortex are decreased in normal elderly subjects, and may be still further reduced in the brains of patients with DAT (White et al, 1977; Davies & Feisullin, 1981; Rinne ef a, 1984; Flynn & Mash, 1985; Candy et al, 1986). Tt may therefore be possible to improve partially the impairment in memory and cognitive function ‘of DAT patients with a cholinergic receptor agonist, such as nicotine. Nicotine, in addition to its post- synaptic action, may also act pre-synaptically, since there is evidence for presynaptic nicotinic auto- receptors promoting ACh release (Rowell & Winkler, 1984; Clarke et a, 1986). The purpose of this study ‘was (o investigate whether nicotine could enhance performance on computerised tests of attention, information processing, and short-term memory in ‘normal elderly subjects and patients with DAT. Method ‘There were three groups: 7 young normal adults (@ men, women, mean age 27 (£8.00 yet, dames); 7 elderly ‘ormal contol subjects (6 men, 1 woman, mean age 70 (2526 years, smokers; and 7 patients with DAT G men, 44 women, mean age 71 (46.02) years, 3 smokers). The 797 National Adult Reading Test (Nelson, 1982) was used to match the thre groups for pre-morbi verballQ, with scores ‘of 12, 120, and 119 respectively. The young adults were ‘tudens nd community vlunter, and the edely controls were community volunteers and the spouses of patents Patients had been asesied at he Matdsley Hospital Memory Clinie(Philpot Levy, 1987), and diagnosed by a consultant psychiatrist in concordance with a second pejhistrist a8 faving DAT following the criteria oulined for ‘probable Alzheimer's disease’ by Meihann el (1985). All patients Selected were considered to bein the mild or moderate stages ofthe disease, and fllin stages 1 or 2 the Clinial Dementia Rating Scale (Hughes ea, 1982) Although the numbers may appear smal, it should be empbasied that itis dificult o obtain erly, well-dagnosed eases of DAT, ‘and to match them so closely wit controls. ‘Subjects and patients attended ening sesions followed by seven test sesions inthe following order: an undrugged baseline sesion, a placebo sesion (saline), three sessions with nicotine (@.4mg, 0.6m, and 0.8 mg), 2 placebo session, and an undrugged baseline session. Data fFom the two baseline sesions and two plasbo sessions were summed land the means calculated. Saline and nicotine were injected Subcutaneously. During the 40-minute test sessions, the patiens and subjets underwent a eres of texts of cognitive Function, including the two computerised tests, the digit span (forward) subtest ofthe Weehsler Adult Inteligence Scale (WAS), the eral icker fasion test (an indirect. measure of eotial arousal) (Smith & Misia, 1976), and the finger-tapping task (a test of motor speed) West & Savi, 1986) “The fist of the wo computerised tasks was primarily test of attention and information procesting, wit a small ‘working memory component, substantially modified and Simplified fom that of Wesnes & Warburton (1984) {8 the Wesnes and Warburton tak, subject were asked t0 ett all sequences of thre conse odd o even dis tour ask, subjects were asked to detect only consecutive, ascending odd or even sequences of digits (.e. 2,4, 6:3, 5,754, 6,8; and 5,7, 9) Digits wee presented on the computer sereen atthe rate of 100 digits per minute and",6

"Vol. 21, No. 78 November 23, 1999 Reynolds Tobacco Lauds Legal Victory in Minnesota Class Action In another important legal victory for the tobacco industry, a federal court in Minnesota has denied cenification of a class-action suit secking smoking cessation and medical monitoring programs for smokers and former smokers in Minnesota. “Federal courts have unanimously rejected certification of tobacco class actions,” said Thomas P. McKim, assistant general counsc! of RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company. “The ruling marks the 10” time that a federal court has rejected this type of case since 1997. We are very pleased that sound legal reasoning, as well as judicial common sense, have once again prevailed.” In denying certification in Janet Thompson et al. v. American Tobacco Company, Inc. et al., the USS, District Court for the District of Minnesota noted: “in the present case this analysis reveals that Piaintiffs’ Complaint is riddled with individual questions that predominate over questions ‘common to the class.” In its 26-page opinion, the Court also said: '* “Plaintiffs argue that this case can be decided without regard to the conduct or condition of Plaintiffs. In other words, Plaintiffs seek to avoid any question as to their own personal responsibility in this matter by shifting focus to the conduct of Defendants. Although establishing that Defendants’ conduct was fraudulent is necessary to the determination of this claim, the conduct and condition of each Plaintiff must also be considered. Each time the conduct or condition of Plaintiffs arises, an individualized inquiry must be undertaken. The first such instance is proof of individual injury. Its clear that in order to sustain this lawsuit Plaintiffs must have suffered some injury as a result of Defendants’ conduct.” (page 18) * “Plaintiffs contend that proof of injury can be established on a class-wide basis without engaging in individualized inquiries of each Plaintiff. Defendants argue that both addiction and increased risk of disease cannot be proven unless an individualized inquiry is undertaken. ‘The Court agrees with Defendants.” (page 19) * “Therefore, in onder to prove injury in this case, each Plaintiff must establish an addiction to cigarettes. With a class of approximately 700,000 individuals, the assessment necessary to make such @ finding would be impracticable and unmanageable and would certainly predominate over questions common to the class.” (page 21) RJRO000001531099914 70029 3778 9L9b seszs",2

"INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE May 14, 1980 Mr. G. R. Gunzenhauser: Re: R&D Smoking Behavior Research (PEP #3820) After several brief discussions with Carroll Tompson and Andy Laurene, I conclude we should forward the PEP to Mr. Horrigan for approval. I agree with you that this should have been included in the Revised Budget. Andy Laurene advises the 1980 cost will be approximately $70,000 rather than $150,000 as shown on the PEP. Also, it is not clear whether the proposed agreement is for 5 years, or 3-5 years, or year-to-year up to 5 years (see PEP and Carroll Tompson's memorandum) > Vege AEA Page As to funding, I would imagine this proposal, if abproved will not cause an overrun in R&D's 1980 budget. My understand- ing from Dr. Laurene is that they do have $30,000 to $40,000 in professional fees not committed. Perhaps unfilled budgeted positions would cover the rest.

It contains unknown chemicals in a ""flavor capsule” which may be harmful. €vTS e920 4. Tobacco is a secondary part of this product; it could be produced without the tobacco. On the other hand, this product is substantially similar to other products which are regulated by FDA, including nicotine gum, drug inhalant delivery systems (asthmatic and other products) and ""Favor"" a “smokeless” cigarette. It is in the public interest that this product receive the same scrutiny afforded to all new products, so as to protect the health of the Anerican public. This product is a cigarette substitute, and thus, has therapeutic use in smoking cessation/reduction. It is important that this product not be given an unfair advantage over other products and devices which have a similar use, 3333 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213 D (412) 578-8064 Cooea 7",0

University of Vermont, 'Lake Placid Cell Science Center and “University of California at Davis ABSTRACT Tracheobronchial epithelial cells from uinea pig are dissociated proteolytically and maintained on a collagen gel atop a transparent crosslinked nitrocellulose membrane. The cells are fed from below with a serumejre, defined medium, and ex poted only to an air interface on top. Maintenance in this manner allows for polarized differentiation of groups of cells £0 that, after eight 10 twelve dave in cul tre, a pseudosiraified ciliated columnar epithelium is formed virtually identical in structure and function to that seen in the intact animal This culture system com bines the advantages of both organ and cell cultures, yet eliminates major probs ems inherent in each technique. The sys tem ie suited ideally for studies of airway epithelial function, such as secretory re: sponses to inrtans and mediators of in Flammarion, as well as studies involving cell diferemiation. gene expression, and ‘carcinogenesis. 62 BioTechnngues INTRODUCTION Excess secretion of mucus into respiratory airways isthe pathogenetic basis for development of a spectrum of pulmonary disorders, ranging from chronic bronchitis and emphysema to te common cold. Thus, definition of mechanisms involved in normal and stimulated secretion of mucusby goblet cells and glands lining the airways has been a goal of pulmonary researchers for decades. Part of the problem has been the lack of an appropriate model system with which 10 study. mucin secretion. In this report, we describe a tech- nique which allows for formation of a ferentiated ciliated and mucin- secreting epithelium in an in vitro sys- tem. Proteolyticall iated. cells from guinea pig trachea or mainstem bronchi are maintained on a collagen gel which sits atop a transparent, cross linked nitrocellulose membrane. The cell cultures are “fed” from below only, and exposed to a humidified air iter faceabove, Maintenance of the cell cul tutesinthis mannerallows for polarized differentiation of isolated cells so that after about 8 days inculture, the pseudo- stratified columnar epithelium formed is virtually identical morphologically and functionally to mucosal epithel- jum in the intact animal. ‘The culture system has been described as part ofa primary research paper in a previous manuscript (15), as bus full characterization of the eel= lular growth kinetics and analysis of cellular secretions. As pointed out in that paper, cells from other rodent air- ‘ways, such as hamster and rabbit, and 50578728 cells isolated from human airways, do ot express differentiated function nearly as well as cells from guinea pig when cultured in this system, This repo will emphasize the technical aspects of the procedure and the use of cells derived from guinea pig airways.

"Appendix = Nava Seoev Requirement of Nucleotide Exchange Factor for Ypt1 GTPase Mediated Protein Transport Sara Jones,* Robert J. Lit {,) Celeste J. Richardson,’ and Nava Segev** Departnents af “Pharmacological and Physiological Sciences, Molecular Geneties and Cel Biology und Biochemistry and Molecalar Biology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Ilinois 60637 Abstract. Small GTPases of the rab family are involved in the regulation of vesicular transport. Itis believed that cycling between the GTP- and GDP-bound forms, ‘and accessory factors regulating thi cycling are crucial for rab function, However, an essential rote for rab mu- cleotide exchange factors has not yet been demon- strated, In this report we show the requirement of nu- cleotide exchange factor activity for Yptl GTPase ‘mediated protein transport. The Yptl protein, a mem- ber ofthe rab family, plays a role in targeting vesicles to the acceptor compartment and i essential for the first two steps ofthe yeast secretory pathway. We use two YPTT dominant mutations that contain alterations in & highly conserved GTP-binding domain, N/2/F and DI2AN. YPTL-DI24N isa novel mutation that encodes a protein with nucleotide specificity modified from gun- nine to xanthine. This provides a tool for the study of an individual rab GTPase in crude extracts: a xan- thosine triphosphate (XTP)-dependent conditional dominant mutation, Both mutations confer growth in- hibition and a block in protein secretion when cx- pressed in vivo, The purified mutant proteins do not bind either GDP or GTP. Moreover, they completely inhibit the ability of the exchange factor to sti nucleotide exchange for wild type Yptt prote potent inhibitors of ER to Golgi transport in the vesicle targeting step. The inhibitory effects of the ‘Yptl-D124N mutant protein on both nucleotide ex- change activity and protein transport in vitro can be re- lieved by XTP, indicating that it isthe nucleotide-free form of the mutant protein that is inhibitory. These re~ sults suggest that the dominant mutant proteins inhibit protein transport by sequestering the exchange factor from the wild type Ypt] protein, and that this factor has an essential role in vesicular transport. ‘way involves their orderly progression through ase~ ries of membranous compartments (Palade, 1975). ‘Transport between successive secretory compartments ap- pears to be mediated by vesicles (Jamieson and Palade, 41067; Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987; Rothman, 1994). How. fever, the mechanisms that regulate the directionality and specificity ofthese vesicular transport steps are not known, ‘The rab/¥ptl/See4 family of small GTPases has been shown to play a role in vesicular trafficking (Ferro-Novick nd Novick, 1993; Zerial and Stenmark, 1993). t hus been suagested that these proteins act at the different steps of the secretory pathway to ensure the fidelity of vesicular targeting (Bourne, 1988; Segev et al., 1988; Lian et al., 1984; Spgarrd et al, 1994). The ability of rab proteins to ‘eycle between GTP- and GDP-bound forms is believed to be crucial for their function (Bourne, et al., 1990).

Most GTP-bind- ing proteins have slow intrinsic rates of guanine nucleotide eachange, and thus requite accessory factors to stimulate the exchange reaction “The importance of nucleotide exchange for function of rab-G TPases has been implied in several studies. Fist, rab proteins thet have a mutation analogous to ras-SI7N, Which tocks the GTPase in the GDP-bound form, have been shovn to inhibit protein transport in vivo and in vitro (Tisdale et al, 1992; Li and Stahl, 1993; Nuoffer et al, 1994; Riederer et a, 1994; Stenmark et al. 1994), Second, the balk ofthe cytosolic pool of several rab proteins is ap parently in the GDP-bound state, since itis found in a Complex with GDP-dissociation inhibitory factor (GDI)! 5.

Church of God Orphanage For the past three years, the Philip Morris Cabarrus Expansion Project Team and Fluor Daniel employees have sponsored ""Operation Our Kids."" This is in support of the Cabarrus County Church of God Orphanage, Each month project team members have provided a birthday party for the children at the orphanage. This party was complete with birthday presents selected for each child, a decorated birthday cake, ice cream, soft drinks and balloons. Project team members took the party supplies to the orphanage every month and celebrated with all the children. During the three years, they also provided money to pay for a chartered bus for the kids and house parents to travel to Disney World; renovated condemned playground equipment; and shared picnics with the house parents and children, For Christmas, gifts were provided for all the children as well as special presents for the entire home such as encyclopedias, CD Rom games and educational software, With the ""winding down"" of the Cabarrus Expansion project, they will not be having birthday parties in 1995. On Tuesday, December 13, members of the project team took their last gifts to the orphanage. They presented staff members and maintenance personnel at the home with potted plants; house parents and staff were given gift certificates; and the home was presented a check for $1200 to use toward whatever they deemed necessary.

"TIME November 15, 1963 CUSTOMS Ads in Reverse The American Cancer Society has thought up a new kind of advertis- ing—uncommercials. Called “Athletes Against Cancer,” the campaign is a Series of cigarette testimonials in re- verse. “I don't smoke,” grins Olympics Decathlon Champion Bob Mathias. “Smoking cuts down on wind. And an athlete needs wind as much as he needs his legs. Athletes in top condition don't smoke—they can’t afford to.” Yankee Pitcher Whitey Ford (who ‘did some testimonial commercials last year for Camels) says: “Cigarette smoking is dangerous for your health. I guess we all know that Science has proved it to ‘be the major cause of lung cancer.” Oth- cer anti-cigarette athletes: Track Stars Jim Beatty and Tom Courtney, Tank Stars Buster Crabbe and Patricia Me- Cormick, Fighters Jack Dempsey, Sug- ar Ray Robinson, and Floyd Patterson. ‘Aiming its ads at young people, the Cancer Society supplies them free to ‘oational teeo-age magazines that will promise to run them (ten have so far Signed up). “We want to change the | 08 MATHIAS. A grove challenge to the young. nrrish poster the cigarette smoker for says a spokesman for the we can just get them before Society, they start!” ‘In Europe the anti-tobacco campaign is far less circumspect. The British Min- istry of Health has put up more than a million posters. One says: “Why be an- other sheep? Before you smoke, THINK. Cigarettes cause lung cancer.” Another shows a half-open coffin, with the leg- end: “The big Flip-Top Box for the Smoker.” In Italy, all tobacco advertis- ing was made illegal in 1962. \ ADVERTISING AGE November 4, 1963 ACS Anti-Smoking Push ‘Succeeds,’ but Resistance Looms New York, Oct. 31—Despite Blowing reports of success of the “Athletes Against Cancer” anti- smoking advertising campaign launched by the American Cancer Society, it appears that the drive is. going to encounter some resistance from media and from at least two cigaret companies. ‘According to Clifton Read, vp of the New York ACS office, the campaign has “exceeded anything ‘we've ever done.” In fact, Mr, Read ‘says the campaign has) been’ ‘successful in print media and ra- lo, that the health organization is ‘expanding its drive into tv. Mr. Read. cautioned thet though media may order the ma- terial, the announcements and ad- vertisements may not necessarily reach the public. “But our chap- ters have to pay for each of these spots themselves and they don't ‘order the material unless there se genuine demand,” he said. Tt was not immediately known which sports personalities will be used in the new series of tv an- ouncements. The society will use “whoever happens to be avail- able,"" Mr, Read said. The radio campaign, which broke early this fall (AA, Sept. 9), featured Whitey Ford, New York Yankees pitching ace, warning youngsters to stay away from cigarets. Troni- cally, Mr. Ford once appeared in testimonial ads for R. J. Reynolds cigarets, = Other sports stars volunteering their services in the ACS adver= tising Include Bob Mathias, Rocky Colavito, Jack Dempsey, Sugar Ray Robinson, Floyd Patterson, Bart 100 364 34.39 Starr, and Jim Beatty. ‘Meantime, the society's _volun- teer agency, Hockaday Associates, is preparing a series of print ads designed for young women con- sumers. One currently in prepara- tion shows a young woman skier who ‘tells feminine readers why she doesn’t smoke. “I only putt felting into my stretch pants. Air ‘on the slopes moves me more than smoke. . . If I don’t know what to-do with my hands T take hhis and dance. So who needs a smoke?” ""RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co. pointed out it “has no control over media, but we always try to see that our product advertising does not appear in the company of in- compatible advertising.” ‘© Douglas Burch, media director of Liggett & Myers, said his com- any ""would not attempt to influ fence the editorial and programing content of media. We are well ‘aware that it would be improper ‘and impossible,” he said, He added that LAM is concerned, however, that “proper separation and pro- tection” of its advertising from anti-smoking announcements be maintained by media. ""In other words, we don't want our ads placed back-to-back with this cane ‘cer campaign.” ‘An ADVERTISING AcE check of major media in New York indi- ated that none has as yet re- ceived the ACS material, Most re fused to offer a “gratuitous opin fon” on material that they have not yet received. An exception was Don’ Perkins, vp and advertising director of Look, who said the ‘magazine “would definitely not ac- cept the ACS material whether it ‘was paid or otherwise. We solicit, accept, and are proud of our clga- ret advertising,” sald Mr. Perkins ""Tt would be unfair to the tobacco industry, since the lnk between smoking’ and cancer is unproved: ACS officials in Chicago sald they had mailed campaign mate- lal to media throughout the state, “AS yet we have received no reaction, either pro or con, on the material or its Usage, ety spokesman, # 1003043489 4 *",9

Dorer Cleveland Veterans Hospital and Department of Biochem!s- try, Case Western Reserve, Cleveland, Ohio, 44106, USA There is an abundant indirect evidence indicating that ctr- culating bradykinin and angiotensin I are metabolized by enzymes situated along the luminal surface of pulmonary endothelial cells (for reviews, sve Ryan,et 01., 1970a, 1972a & b: Smith & Ryan, 4973; Ryan & Ryan, 1973). The metabolism of bradykinin results in loss of biological activity, but the activity of angiotensin I is . enhanced, in part by Conversion to its Tover homolog, angiotensin 1}. Recently, Dorer,ct a1. (1972, 1974a) have succeeded in 1501 a- ting an enzyne (angiotensin converting enzyme or kininase 11) from pig lung which has the capacity of metabolizing angiozensin I and bradykinin to produce metabolites like those prod ced by intact Jungs: The enzyme converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II by re— leasing the C-terminal dipeptide, His-Leu, and inactivates brady Kinin by releasing the C-terminal dipeptide, Phe-Arg (cf Ryan, et 21. 5 1969, 19702 & b, 1971). Furthermore, the enzyme shows the v sake selectivity of metabolism as was observed with intact lung: mone of the higher homologs of bradykinin is inactivated as fact as is bradykinin itself (Ryan,et al., 1970a; Roblero,et al. , 1973: forer,et al-, 1974). Inactivation of the honologs appears to vary ‘inversely with size and charge.

Box 96205 Phoenix, AZ 85072-6205 Re: Lost order Dear Sir or Madam: Enclosed please find two (2) letters from your office signed by me concerning my order of approximately October 24, 1996. The combination of the two (2) letters correctly identify the items ordered on the entry form. I have enclosed an additional photocopy of the order form I retained when mailed to you on October 24, 1996. In addition, I enclose a photocopy of the front and back side of my check dated October 24, 1996. This check was endorsed by a representative of Marlboro on November 11, 1996 and cleared my bank on November 14, 1996. I cannot specifically identify all portions of your endorsement other than it clearly went through your Chase Manhattan Bank at 55 Water Street and has a reference to Marlboro on said endorsenent. My bank does not return the original checks to its customers and therefore I had to order this information from their micro film department, which explains the delay in my response. Now that I have proved to you that you received my order form, since you did receive my check mailed along with the order form and endorsed said check obtaining the funds presented thereby, would you please immediately see to the delivery of the items ordered through your promotion. I would also be interested in knowing what additional accommodation Marlboro will make to me for the malfeasance in processing this order form approximately six (6) months ago. I have had to expend considerable time in telephoning the Marlboro promotional office to inquire as to location of my order shipment, wait for your internal investigation, and then prove through documents that were not easily obtained, that Marlboro had in fact received my order and check indicated by your endorsement. 6270818902",0

The northeast sales region where complaints arc mainly from is represented by Don Fitzgerald who is not available until sometime Friday at the earliest. Andi asked me to not schedule a meeting for all parties to discuss until she and her future replacement Rebecca Fulton have a chance to talk to Don Fitzgerald first. Andi talked to someone who is at the ongoing Sales meeting where complaints were expressed, and said that they were stated as generalities - she is going to ask for specifics and any suggested changes. Andi said her preliminary feelings are that these will probably be mostly the same old complaints (""I don't think we should have to code invoices"", ""RR isn't paying vendors quickly”, ""Odd size invoices are hard to fax"", etc.) she has heard since the old “TPS"" system for paying sales office expense invoices was replaced months ago with the Disbursements Accounting system. ‘The old “TPS "" system was replaced because of serious control weaknesses that were costing the Company money. Some of the problems with the old system were: ‘overpayments, duplicate payments, field sometimes paid balances rather than invoices, vendor master set-up, payments to vendors in 2 days regandless of terms, retention of invoices for 7 years in sales offices, no BEO reporting, and no 1099 reporting. Currently invoices are received in the field, ledger-coded, approved, and faxed to Disbursements for payment. Perhaps there is room for improvement in the process; 1 am aware that consolidation of bills by vendors is currently under discussion in Disb Accounting. In summary, I expect to know more after Andi and Rebecca meet with Don Fitzgerald. ‘We will meet with Disb if necessary and will keep you informed. Zlos Zvoes",2

THE MACROPHAGE-MEDIATED REGULATION OF HEPATOCYTE SYNTHESIS OF ANTITHROMBIN Ill AND @1-PROTEINASE INHIBITOR Maureane Hoffman, Herbert E. Fuchs, snd gelvatore V. Pizzo Departments of Pathology, Biochemistry” a ‘Duke University Medical Center, Durham, ‘North Carolina 27710 ors a (Received 4.9.1985: Accepted in revised form 12.12.1985 by Editor K.M. Brinkhous) ABSTRACT. Antithrombin IM (ATI) is an anticoagulant protein which binds and inactivates thrombin and other serine proteinases. Little is known about regulation of its synthesis. We confirm that ATIII is synthesized by isolated Fat hepatocytes, and that its synthesis is not sltered by direct feedback of its. ‘complexes with proteinases. Neither is hepatocyte synthesis of ATIII altered by supernatants from macrophages cultured in the presence of ATII- proteinase complexes. However, culture of macrophages with fibrinogen fragment D results In production of a factor(s) in the macrophage supernatants which stimulates hepatic fibrinogen synthesis, as previously described, and also stimulates the synthesis of ATII and aj-proteinase Inbibitor (a1 PD. Synthesis of albumin and rat a2-macrogiobulin (a2M) Is not altered. Culture of macrophages in the presence of bacterial endotoxin also results in release of a factor(s) into the medium which stimulates the same. changes In hepatocyte protein synthesis. ‘These results show for the first time a mechanism by which synthesis of ATI! can be regulated during coagulation and fibrinolysis. INTRODUCTION In orger to maintain fluidity of circulating blood, yet allow for effective coagulation when required for hemostasis, the plasma levels of endogenous pro- and anticoagulant proteins must be regulated within narrow llmits. Relatively litte 1s known, however, about the mechanisms by which synthesis of most coagulation proteins is modulated. Antithrombin Il (ATHI) is an anticoagulant protein which Is the molor inhibitor of activated clotting factors, particularly thrombin and IXa. ATI binds to serine proteinases to form inactive ATilI-proteinase complexes (1). Binding is enhanced, In the presence of heparin. Much indirect evidence exists that ATIII is synthesized in the liver. Plasma ATIII levels fall when there Is a loss of hepatic parenchyma (2,3).

"RW Inter-office Memorandum Subject: To: FOURTH EXPERIMENT TO BE PERFORMED BY NCI Date: May 30, 1972 BEAGLE DOG INHALATION EXPERIMENTS Mr. E, A, Vassallo From: Murray Senkus st Auerbach Experiment In 1970, Dr. Auerbach completed exposure of dogs to cigarette sinoke in which the smoke was admitted into the respiratory tract through a slit in the windpipe. In one group of 86 dogs, smoking was continued for 875 days. He alleged that two of these dogs developed cancer in the lungs, although all medical workers agreed that these tumors were totally different from human tumors. Moreover, many medical research men maintain that the beagle is not a suitable animal for these studies. A number of research people from the industry met with representatives, of the NCI to (1) convince the NCI that Auerbach's conclusions were not valid, and (2) the repetition of the Auerbach experiment would be of no value. None theless, the NCI has decided to repeat the Auerbach experiments. Second Auerbach Experiment The second Auerbach experiment will start on August 1 and will probably last two years. The cigarettes will be manufactured by Philip Morris. Objective of the Experiment 7 Dr. Gori of the NCI stated that the primary purpose of the experiment is to study the effect of nicotine on dogs; however, all animals in the experiment will be examined for tumors, so the data on tumor production will also be determined. Cigarettes to be Smoked : A, A low nicotine (.3% nicotine) blend of flue-cured, Turkish and burley tobaccos. Above blend sprayed with sufficient nicotine (a mixture of salts of tartaric, citric, malic and oxalic acids) to bring the level of nicotine up to 2%. Cigarettes in groups’A and B will be nonfilter, 85’mm in length:, Group “A cigarettes will be regarded as low nicotine; group B cigarettes will be regarded as slightly higher than normal nicotine, eP Number of Dogs to be Used : Forty-five dogs will be smoked with low nicotine cigarettes, 55 dogs will be smoked with high nicotine cigarettes, 25 dogs will be sham smoked. — Jhas 4",0

(Printed in Great Britain) B Identification of a surface membrane proton-translocating ATPase in promastigotes of the parasitic protozoan Leishmania donovani Dan ZILBERSTEIN® and Dennis M. DWYERt *Department of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Iaifa 32000, Israel, and $Cell Biology und Immunology Section, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, US.A. “+ ATPase wctivities were measured in surface membranes and mitochondria isolated from promastigotes of the parasitic protozoan Leishmania donovani. The 0wo enzymes were differehtiated on the basis of pH ‘optima, inhibitor sensitivity and by immunochemical methods. The surface-membrane (SM-) ATPase had aan activity of 100 nmol/min per mg of protein, which was optimal at pH 6.5. The enzyme was Mg- ‘dependent, partially inhibited by Ca®*, and unaffected by Na* or K. The SM-ATPase was inhibited by orthovanadate, NN'-dicyclohexylearbodi-imidc, and N-ethylmaleimide (IC,, (concentration causing half- ‘maximal inkibition) 7.5, 25 and 520 jst respectively}; however, it was unaffected by ouabain, azide or oligomycin. The SM-ATPase demonstrated a K,, of 1.05 mw and a V_,,, of 225 nmol/min per mg of protein. Moreover, fine-structure cytochemical results demonstrated that the SM-ATPase was localized to the cytoplasmic lamina of the parasite SM. A method was devised for the isolation of SM-derived vesicles, These were used to demonstrate the proton-pumping capacity of the SM-ATPuse, Cumulatively, these results constitute the first demonstration of a surface-m protozoan, INTRODUCTION Species of the parasitic protozoan Leishmania are the causative agents of a wide variety of human cutaneous, mucocutaneous and visceral diseases. These organisms have a digenetic life cycle in which both developmental slages reside in hydrolytic environments, i., as extra- cellular agellated promastigote forms within the alimen- tary tract of their sandfly vector and as obligate intracellular amastigote forms within secondary Iyso- somes of human macrophages (Chang & Dwyer. 1978 Berman et aly 1979; Dwyer, 1979; Tim et al, 1980; Bordice etal, 1982), Previously we demonstrated that L. donovani pro- rastigotes possess active transport systems which are protonmotive-force (pml -driven (Zilberstein & Dwyer, 1985), ic., a proton clecirochemical gradient is created across the parasite surface membrane (SM) which is coupled to transport systems by maintaining symport translocation of specific substrates with protons. Such plasma-membrane activities have been deseribed in bacteria (Zilberstein et al., 1979; Kaback, 1983) and fungi (Eddy & Nowacki, 1971; Goffeau & Slayman, 1981; Perlin et al, 1984) as well as in membranes of various cel organelies (Oshumi & Anraku, 1981 ; Fishkes & Rudnick, 1982; Reeves, 1983), Ina variety of cells and organelles, membrane-bound proton-translocating ATPases (H"" demonstrated to be energy transducers whieh utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to generate a proton electro- chemical gradient (Gotfeau & Slayman, 1981 ; Oshumi & Anraku, 1981; DuPont e7 ai., 1982; Galloway er al., ‘brane proton-translocating ATPase in a parasitic 1983; Reeves. 1983; Al-Awgati, 1986; Pederson & Carafoli, 1987). As’ pm drives energy-transduction processes cross the leishmanial SM_(Zilberstein & Dwyer, 1985), it was anticipated that an H*-ATPase acting asa primary proton pump should be present in the plasma membrane of this organism. Previously, it was suggested that the leishmanial SM_ might contain an ATPase (Dwyer & Gottlieb, 1983). In the present study we have identified and characterized a vanadate-sensitive Mgt'-dependent ATPase activity in isolaied SMs of L. donovani promastigotes and demonstrated that this enzyme is a proton pump.

SYMINGTONT AND RICHARD KoLODNER Labomtoy of Boston, WA 0 Communicoted by Charles C. Richardson, July 8, 1985. ABSTRACT An enzyme from Saccharomyces cereisoe ‘that cleaves Holliday junctions was partially purified ~S00- (0 1000-fold by DEAE-celllose chromatography, gel ftration on ‘Sephacry1 $300, and chromatography on slag stranded DNA cellulose. The partaly purified enzyme did not have any detectable nuclease activity when tested with single-stranded or double-stranded bacteriophage T7 substrate DNA and did not have detectable endonuclease activity” when tested with bacterlophage M13 viral DNA or plasmid pBR322 covalently closed circular DNA. Analysis ofthe products ofthe cruciform Cleavage reaction by lerophoreis on peyacrylamie ees under denaturing conditions revealed thatthe eruelform struc: ture was cleaved at elther of two sites present in the stem of the ‘eruelform and was not cleaved at the end of the stem, The ‘rucform cleavage enzyme was able to cleave the Hollidsy Junction present in bacteriophage G4 figure-S molecules. Eighty percent of these Holliday Junctions were cleaved Inthe proper orientation to generate intact chromosomes during enctic recombination. Ic has been proposed that genetic recorsbinaton ofenin- volves the formation of an intermediate structure that con- tains a reciprocal single-stranded crossover between (wo homologous duplexes, the Holliday junction (1-3). When the ing genomes are circular, the Holliday intermediate has a figure-8 configuration. DNA molecules containing Holliday structures have been observed in recombining phage and plasmid DNA molecules isolated (com Escherichia coli and yeast cells and in chromosomal DNA isolated from yeast 4-10). The enzymology ofthe formation and resolution of Holliday structures is not well understood, but the RecA. and Recl proteins, from E. coli and Ustlago maydis, respectively, probably play a role in the formation of Holliday junctions in these organisms (11.12), Resolution of the Holliday junction requires cleavage of the crossed strands, realignment, and ligation to generate an intact recombinant duplex. The bacteriophage 17 gene 3 and bacteriophage 4 gene 49 endonucleases cleave arificialy constructed Holliday structures (13, 14). Conditionally eth ‘tuations in these genes lead to an ace branched DNA after infection, suggesting products may resolve branched recombin (3, 15-17). Artificial Holliday junctions containing. the bacteriophage A ait sites within the crossover repion ate cleaved by the A Int protein (28). The 14 and 7 enzymes. differ from the Int protein in that they have endonuclease activity on single-stranded substrates and lack sequence specificity whereas the Int protein has no single-stranded DNA-specific endonuclease activity and only cleaves Halliday junctions constructed from d at sites (14, 18, 19).

Secondary objectives of the research were to have the target smoke several of the prototypes and relate their reactions to the cigarette. Additionally, we were interested in the target's responses to several packaging options and various promotion and on-pack insert concepts. METHODOLOGY Qualitative research was conducted in Chicago on August 28 and 29, 1989. Most participants were shown 7-9 advertising OOH comps and asked io write down and then discuss several topics regarding the advertising. ‘The topies can be summarized as follows: - To what age group would this advertising appeal the most? - Is the advertising aimed at men, women or both? - How would you describe the woman in the advertising? = Can you relate to the woman in the ads? Next, participants were asked to review and discuss six print executions and various headlines which could appear on the ads. In addition to the product testing, respondents were exposed to several packaging options, promotion and on-pack insert concepts. r i Nite aisle 1027 EAN (OI S86 PIS 88€8 6IZos",0

"RUR Mr. Derick A. Crawford August 4, 1982 RJR-Macdonald, Inc. Montreal RE: Dr. M. H. Bilimoria Dear Derick: Confirming our telephone conversation in early July, in my judg- ment, the Bilimoria/Ecobichon projects with reference to ""studies on ambient tobacco smoke"" and on the “usefulness of the micro-nucle test"", should be rejected because they are unimaginative proposals without good scientific foundations, and, in addition, have a number of political pitfalls. However, the most important reason for my recom- mending their rejection is the scientific worthlessness of the project. There has been a tremendous literature on the alleged relationships between carcinogenic activity and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH). ‘The consensus at the present tine is that this reaction is not a good indicator or predictor for carcinogenic activity. Furthermore, all animal models tried to date are unsuitable for simulating the alleged effects of smoking on human smokers, and even more unsuitable for simu- lating “passive smoking” in man. This applies particularly to rats. ‘This is shown, for example, in a very recent paper by S. M. Loscutoff et al, and A. P. Wehner, entitled ""Dosimetry and Cardiopulmonary Function in Rats Chronically Exposed to Cigarette Smoke"", ‘Toxicology Appl. 64 335-352 (June 30, 1962), which demonstrates and refers to previous literature showing that the smoke taken in is in complete disequilibrium with reference to gas phase, particulate phase, etc., a compared to smoke taken in by human smokers. Any results which would be obtained by Bilimoria, regardless whether favorable or unfavorable from our point of view, would be meaningless. Similar reasonings apply to the micronucleus test as a biological monitor of tobacco smoke exposure. Cigarette smoke has been shown many times to be mutagenic. It has also been shown, even by those who very strongly believe in mutagenesis ti that such tests, at best, have a qualitative significance and are quantitatively meaningless. I personally hold an exceedingly dim view of even the qualitative usefulness of such tests. Adding another test to those already reported in the literature, is, in my judgment, total waste. I have been informed that Dr. Fagan of Philip Morris has advised your counterpart in Canada by telephone about a month ago, or earlier, that he considers the Bilimoria projects worthless. Dr. Fagan has. Promised me that he will make an attempt to repeat his comments in writing. bap, ( oece wzeos cc: S.B.W., P.J.vE. Frank G. Colby ve Cun ¥ gAs",0

Campa, J. FRASER GLICKMAN, KYOHEt YAMAMOTO, AND KWEN-IEN CHANGt Division of Cel Biology, Burroughs Wellcome Co., Research Tingle Park, NC 27709 Communicated by George H. Hitchings, May 1, 1992 ABSTRACT The antibiotic azatyrosine (DL-3-(5-hydroxy- 2-pyridyDalanine] suppressed meiotic maturation in oocytes Induced by progesterone or the combination of [Val!™]p21t== ‘microinjection and insulin-like growth factor I. The suppres- sion was dose-dependent in the range of 20-250 1M azaty- rosine. In addition, azatyrosine blocked the tyrosine phosphor ylation of Xp42, a member of the mitogen-activated protein ‘kinase family, after progesterone or [Val!?}p21!=""™/ insulin-ike growth factor I stimulation. Activation of matura- tion-promoting factor, as shown by a decrease in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the Xenopus homolog of p24°2, was also Suppressed by azatyrosine. Azatyrasine had no effect in vivo or in vitro on the growth factor-induced autophosphorylation of the oocyte insulin-like growth factor T receptor. Azatyrosine hhas been shown by others [Shindo-Okada, N., Makabe, 0. Nagahara, H & Nishimura, S. (1989) Mol. Carcinog. 2, 159-167] to inhibit the growth of ras-transformed cells without affecting that of nontransformed cells. In oocytes, the antibiotic ‘exerts an inhibitory action on both a ras-dependent and 9 vras-Independent pathway. Lack of an effect of azatyrosine on ‘germinal vesicle breakdown induced by the microinjection of ‘an extract from mature oocytes, however, suggests that aza- tyrosine is acting upstream of maturation-promoting factor activation, ‘The high incidence of mutated ras genes in human eancer (1, 2) has led many investigators to direct theit research efforts toward ras as a potential target for cancer therapies. One approach has been to block the biosynthesis of the oncogene product by expression of antisense mRNA (3). This method ‘was utilized in a human lung cancer cell line to block the production of the K-ras protein and has also met with some ‘success in an in vivo tumor model. Another approach takes advantage of the ability of mutated ras proteins to cause transformation when expressed in cultured cells, By using this technique, large numbers of compounds can be screened ‘on the basis of differential effects on the growth of the transformed vs. the parental cel line. This method was used by Shindo-Okada ef a. (4) to identify & potential antitumor ‘compound, azatyrosine. Azatyrosine, an antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces chibanensis, inhibited the growth of NIL 313 cells transformed by Ha-ras but had little effect on the growth of nontransformed cells, Moreover, azatyrosine ‘caused the phenotypic reversion of transformed cells that persisted even after the antibjotic was removed from the cculture medium. Beceuse the effect of azatyrosine appeared to be quite specific for the ras-transformed cells, we chose to investigate ‘The publication costs of his article were defeayed i pat by pe charge payment. This rile mus therefure be heret matked ""advertisement in accondance with I8 U.S.C. 41734 soll to indicate this ft. 1658 its action in a totally different ras-dependent system. Prophase-arrested oocytes of the African clawed frog Xeno- ‘pus laevis can be induced to mature in vitro by progesterone, insulin, or insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). The pathway involving insulin or IGF-I requires endogenous ras protein (5) ‘and can be activated in the absence of exogenous hormone or growth factor by the microinjection of oncogenic forms of ras (6). In contrast, the progesterone pathway is independent of the ras gene product. Use of the oocyte system, therefore, permits the investigation ofthe effects of azatyrosine on two Separate pathways, both culminating in a common end, meiotic maturation. In this paper, we show that azatyrosine suppressed mat- uration in oocytes induced by the combination of ras micro- injection and IGF-I. The antibiotic also inhibited progester- ‘onesinduced maturation. Progesterone or ras/IGF-1 treat- meat of oocytes induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Xp42, ‘8 member of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family (7), prior to germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). This tyrosine phosphorylation of Xp42. was blocked by azaty- rosine. The antibiotic had no detectable effect, however, on the autophosphorylation of the oocyte IGF-I receptor.

Yanada Research Service of the Veterans Administration Wadsworth Medical Center and the Departaents of Hedicine, Opthalmology, and Pharmacology, UCIA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, Ch. (Received in final form June 21, 1982) Summary. Donperidone, a dopamine receptor antagonist vhich apparently does Bot penetrate the blood-brain barrier in rats was administered to adult males. Dosperidone 500 pg and 100ug, given through intracarotid cannula, significantly elevated plasma prendorphtn~ inounoreactivity (-EP-I) at #15 ein. To show that only a peripheral site(s) of action is implicated, domeridone was given fo rats by canutlae implanted into both lateral venteicles. Plasma BrEP-I was unaffected by this route of adainistration. These results suggest that plasya -EP-I is tonically inhibited by dopamine acting at site(s) outside of the blood-brain barrier. Plasma rendorphin (f-EP) levels are thought to reflect secretion from.the anterior pituitary gland. Plasua B-EP usually responds to the sane agents and : influences which modulate plasma S-lipotropin (G-Ltll) and advenocortieotropia, (AcTH) (1-3), Although most studies indicate that these peptides are secreted coordinately, recentiy dexamethasone was shown to suppress plasae B-EP levels without affecting B-LPH (4). This suggests that sone pituitary cells may secrete nostly PEP into the systenic cirevlation. ‘The pituitary intermediate lobe contains high concentrations of B+EP-like Peptides derived from the same pro-opionelanocortin precursor found in the anterior lobe(S-7). In vitko experiments have shova that the iatermediate lobe responds to a different set of agents than those effecting secretion from the anterior lobe and dopanine has been shown to suppress intermediate lobe secretion of PEP-Like peptides(8,9). Recently, dopaminergic regulation of canine and rat plasma B-EP-I has been observed (10-12). This is inhibited by pre-infusion with Gopanine or other dopamine receptor antagonists. We sought to extend these observations to the rat and to evaluate whether a dopamine receptor antagonist activates secretion of B-EP-I only at a site(s) outside of the bloodsbrain Partier. Domperidone, a dopamine receptor antagonist which may not cross the Dlood-brain barrier vhen aduinistered peripherslly, was chosea to investigate these issues (13). 0024~3205/82/100981-05603.00/0 Copyright (c) 1982 Perganon Press Ltd. 50238023",6

Sales for the quarter ended Oct. 10 were reported at $661 million, down 3.9 percent from the previous year's $687.7 million. The company blamed the decline on poor weather in Northeastern resort areas, low food prices, the recession, and news that Grand Union is looking to sell its Southem region stores. ""Dinkins to Propose $162 Million in New Taxes to Plug Budget"" ‘The Associated Press (11/17/92) New York--Mayor David Dinkins will propose $162 million in new taxes ‘on alcohol, cigarettes, commuters and commercial use of fuel to help close a $1.3 billion gap in next year's budget, the Daily News reported today. Dinkins will release the iax package for the fiscal year beginning next July 1 on Thursday, along with a new long-term financial plan, the ‘News said. According to the newspaper, the proposal would raise $67 million by increasing the income tax on commuters. Those who live in suburban New York State would receive rebates, but commuters from Connecticut and New Jersey would not. Similar plans have met with disfavor in the state Legislature in the past. Dinkins’ proposal would raise $39 million in ""sin"" taxes on alcohol and tobacco, of which $10 million ‘would be dedicated to an anti-smoking campaign, the News said. The package also includes a $56 million tax on the commercial use of fuels, =<"" the newspaper said. a p Eee id mokeless Workplaces Cut Overall Tobacco Use"" wl ye 4 5 United Press International (11/18/92) ~ — —— ew -Orleans--A University of Californi: \cisco, study i rr Ig policies influence workers to Z cut down on smoking during their off hours.

The majority of smokers are lower to middle income poople-thoce least able to afford it, Washington already makes more money from taxing cigaretes than cigarette companies dp from selling them, Where is this money going? ‘Even more unbelievable isthe argument that this financial tax windall wil kee kid from smoking. T always thought that parents, not Big Government, had responsiblity for the proper upbringing of our youth Huge tax increases alone won't reduce youth sinoking. According to data from the US Centers for Disease Control, 11 ofthe 13 states that raised tobacco taxes in the early 1990's saw an increase in youth seoking in the years that fellowed. In addition, President Clinton and Congress alo fail to mention that 98 percent of cigaretes sold are smoked by those of legal age: only 2 percent are smoked by minors. The new tax proposals would tax 98 percent to try to influence 2 percent. Even more incredible, the new taxes would create a huge black market for cigarettes (which has already happened in Canada, where cigarette taxes had tobe rescinded). Ironically, a black market makes cigarettes more accessible to cour kids. Where is the logic ere? Massive taxes to discourage or prevent use of a legal product (is prohibition next?), no matter how potentially harmful, isa violation of our rights as American citizens, Which legal product will be next? Isn't it time we saved ourselves from Big Government? urge you to oppose this unfair and regressive tax. Lets find more effective ways to reduce youth smoking.

Lim, J. J. Mullins, C-M. Chea, K. Gross, and L. E. Maguat, EMBO J. 82613-2619, 1989). Each transgene produces properly processed albeit abnormally unstable mRNA as well as several smaller RNAs in erythroid cells. These smaller RNAS are detected only in the cytoplasm and, relative to mRNA, are Tonger-lived and are missing sequences from either exon Tor exons [and LL, La this communication, we show by using genetics and SI nuclease transcript mapping that the prematurs termination of fizlobin mRNA translation is mechanistically required for the abnormal RNA metabolism. We also provide evidence that ‘generation of the smaller RNAS isa cytoplasmic process: the 5” ends of intron L-contaiing pre-mRNAs were formal, the rates of removal of introns 1 and 2 were normal, and studies inhibiting RNA synthesis with fctinomycin D demonstrated  precursor-product relationship between full-length mRNA and the smaller RNAs. In vivo, about 50% of the full-length species that undergo decay ave degraded tothe smaller RNAS and the rest are degraded to undetectable products. Exposure of erythroid cells that expressed a normal human ‘Bealobin transgene to either cycloheximide or puromycin did not result in the zeneration of the smaller RNAS. ‘Therefore, a drug-induced reduction in cellular protein synthesis does not produce this aspect of cytoplasmic ‘mRNA metabolism, These data suggest that the premature termination of -iobia mRNA translation in either ‘exon Tor exon Il results in the ytoplasmic generation of discrete mRNA degradation products that are missing Sequences from exon I or exons T and I rucleolytie cleavage mRNA exists to be translated into protein. However, evidence suggests that in the process of being traasiated, the fabundance of an mRNA can be altered. For some mRNAs, abundance is increased ifthe coding region isnot translated fn full, Examples of this type include mRNAS for the replication-dependent human histones (10, 18, 26); human fas (19, 41, 42}; murine comyc (50); yeust MATal (35); and hamster, chicken, murine, and sea urchin B-tubulin (16, 17, 534, 51, 52) In each case, translation to atleast u certain point ‘within the coding region of the mRNA appears to be required for mRNA degradation, and nonsense codons that reside upstream of that point are associated with an increase in mRNA abundance. While similar in this regard, however, each of these mRNAS is not degraded as a function of the Same features of translation. Histone mRNA degradation at the end of S phase requires that ribosomes translate to within ‘a specific distance of a hairpin structure that resides in the 3 untranslated region. In contrast, cfos, c-myc, and MATal mRNA degradation seems to require ribosome translation across @ specific region of the coding sequence. And, as another variation, B-lubulin mRNA decay depends upon an texoess of free tubulin that presumably interacts with the frst, ‘Famino acids of an actively elongating, nascent peptide, For mRNAs of another type, the presence of nonsense ‘codons is associated with a decrease in mRNA abundance. Examples of this type include mRNAs for human f-globin = Corresponding sur. + Present address: Cardiovascular Division, Department of Ine: nal Medicine, University of Towa Collegeof Medicine, Towa City, Tasz222, ce these degradation produ nonsense codons tested, there is no correlation berween the position of tr 19 jppear to be the same forall in termination and the sites of (2, 4, 23, 24 «33, 45), rabbit B-globin (41), murine imminoglobuli. » 3), adenovirus ELA’ (20), yeast URAS (28), yeast HIS! <1), hamster dihydrofolate reductase (49), Rous sarcom ws gag (3), and human triosephosphate isomerase (11, 11 as well as many bacterial mRNAS (te viewed in refe.cr-e 6).

"ip 1 yoy ‘ To the 3,000,000 people who started smoking this year. Despite all the arguments against smoking, one simple fact remains. Last year, three million people started to smoke. This year, the criticism will continue. And next year, too. But after all is said and done, another three million people will probably start smoking. Maybe the people who criticize smoking should stare the facts in the face. Then they might recommend that if you've decided to smoke, but are concerned about ‘tar’ and nicotine, you might smoke Vantage. Vantage offers smokers the rich, tobacco flavor they've come to appreciate. With a substantial cut in ‘tar’and nicotine. So if you're one of those smokers who is now deciding between high ‘tar and nicotine cigarettes that taste good, and low ‘tar’ and nicotine cigarettes that taste like nothing, you might appreciate Vantage. == Because Vantage is both high in flavorand low in ‘tar’ and nicotine. That's why so many people who have smoked for many years have switched to Vantage. And that’s why, if you've just started to smoke this year, we suggest you try Vantage yourself aig Te Surgeon Gest Has Deterined om ‘Tra Uiguete Sek Dangers toes 08s 5 W.Ghng ee Dg RE HANTS,",4

Group Rescerch and Development Centre, Britith-Ameriesn Tobacco Co. Ltd, Southampton, Englend INTRODUCTION Ina previous study (1), the regions in which gases were formed inside a cigarette combustion coal, the conditions under which they were formed, and how these regions varied during the smoking eyele, were determined. The tgses formed in the coal distribute themselves beoween the mainstream and sidestceam smoke, In the present sudy, the gar semperature and concentrations ouside the coal have been meatured, ia order co determine ‘where the permanent gases enter the sidestream plume, nd how the sidesream formation varies during the Smoking cyele, In addision, caleuations have been per Formed in order to clarify certain aspects of the for~ ‘mation ofthe sidetream smote plume. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS “The gas temperature and concentration distributions ex ternal to the coal have been obtained coneurcenely using exactly the same «ype of cigarette, sampling. probe / ‘thermocouple, experimental system, and computer pro- prams as previously described (1). The cigarette was Smoked in'an atmosphere of 21% (v/v) oxygen /79%/e (els) argon inside a cubie perspex chamber of 140 mma side, The gas mixture was passed vertically chrough the Chamber at a flow rate of 250 em? st, or a linear vel- ‘city of 12.8 mm s"" past the cigarette, equivalent to a Beaufort force 0 sir condition, Le. “calm aic” (2). In successive experiments the sampling tip of the probe was Positioned directly above the coal, and at angles of 45°, 50° and 180° (ie. directly below the coal) from a ver~ tical line through the axial cencre of the coal, and for to 15 mm from the surface of the cigareste, and at distances of between —10 and +10 mm from the line ‘of paper burn atthe start of the puff (Table 1). At lease four replicate experiments were performed for each po- sition of the probe. RESULTS External temperature and concentration contours at various stages during the emoking cycle are shown in Figures 1 xo 16. These contours are very sensitive to movements in the external atmosphere, a5 is the visible fidestream smoke. The exteraal contours in the present seudy were obtained with che oxygen/argon smoking stmosphere flowing vertically past the cigarette with a linear velocity of 12.8 mms"". This imposed velocity is small compared to the total velocity in the sidesream plume of 330mm s"", as measured by Newrath and co- ‘workers (3). Thus the imposed flow should only have a ‘minimal effect on the plume. Taking ‘the characreriie dimension of the smokins chamber asthe length ofits side (140 mm), the Reynolds ‘umber for the imposed flow of 12.8 mm s* through the chamber is 116. Thus the flow conditions pase the cigarette out to be laminar. In confirmation of this the sidesream smoke plume was oberserved to rise from the coal in-a very straight column (Figure 47). ‘The 954% confidence limite (mean of four replicates) of temperature at each point are about 25°C, and. are bout + 10% of the mean values forthe gas concentra- tions. These confidence limits are dve predominantly to slight variations in-the eigareres used, and the inability to mount the probe into identical positions in-the side~ stceam plume for cach replicate experimentrather than ‘ny variation in the thermocouple temperature/or mas spectrometric concentration measurements. Amore de- tailed account of the errors involved-in these types of ‘measurements has been given previouly (1). LozgLerosz",6
"lc Pre SOO lV meeting Rome Fa - 48S 4B 9 Here THE SOD ACTIVITY VERSUS TOXICITY OF TERNARY COMPLEXES OF SOME COPPER COMPLEXES WITH DNA GIDON CZAPSKI AND SARA GOLDSTEIN Department of Physical Chemistry, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 91904, IsraeT INTRODUCTION It has been demonstrated that degradation of double-stranded DNA occurs in the Presence of Cu(II) ions, 1,10-phenanthroline (OP), 8 reducing agent and 02 (1-2). The copper complex of 5-NO3-0P was found to be more effective than OP in cleav= ing DNA, white that of 2,2-bipyridy] (bipy) did not degrade NA under the same conditions (1-3)."" The mechanism of the cleavage reaction was assumed to be through a site specific mechanism where the bound Cu(1) complex to DNA is oxi- dized by H,0, to form the OH"" radical at the binding site. This mechanism ex- Plains the toxicity of the OH"" formed as it is formed at the binding site and can hardly be scavenged. Discussion The reaction scheme for bound and free copper complexes (CuL3*, Cul}, Cut3) include the following steps: puascuts*, oN cuL§*or onazcurg* + 05 —+ cuts or pnazcutg + 0, a Cutg or DNAzCUL3 + 1,0, —» cuL3* or oNAzCuLZ* + OH” + On @ DNA or DNA=CuL3* + OH"" —+ damage «@) In addition the reoxidation of Cu(I1) by oD can occur: 4) + cut + on + 2H* 2s ary CuLZ or DNASCUL} + 03 + 2H” —~ cuLZ* or vnazcuLs* + HZ02 If we analyze the sequence of these reactions we find that reactions (1) and (2) describe the catalysis of the Haber-Weiss reaction which yields the deleterious OH"", while reactions (1) and (4) describe the catalysis of the dismutation of 03 and hence prevent the formation of OH"". Thus a copper compound can serve either as a catalyst of the Haber-Weiss reaction or as a catalyst of the dismutation of 03. It turns out that whether the copper compound catalyzes the dismutation of 03 or catalyzes the Haber-Weiss reaction depends on the competition between re- actions (2) and (4), It has been shown that k4/kz > 10° for the various free copper complexes (4) and since in most biological systems [H202}/103}< 109 (5), the dismutation of 03 predominates and we do not expect any appreciable produc- tion of OH"" through the Haber-wWeiss reaction and no toxicity is expected (6). The question is how is 03 toxic in the presence of these copper complexes? We PUBLICATIONS 010501",6

"THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE, tne To: Committee of Counsel (CONFIDENTIAL) FROM: Horace R. Kornegay suBgECT: “Shubik Blasts Tobacco Industry Scientists"" The attached story on “Shubik Blasts Tobacco Industry Scientists"" in the Cancer Newsletter October 4, 1974 is accurate in its essentials. However, the target of Shubik's attack was tobacco industry-funded research. Dr. Shubik exploded after Bob Hockett's presentation of such research funded by CTR at the Tobacco working Group meeting. His statement, “It shocks me that 20 years later (after the health hazards of cigarettes had become evident) you have not joined the community of men. You will go down in history denying facts well-known to the scientific community. When I see people die of a preventable disease, and I know what caused it, I get very angry. It offends me when people who are scientists and who know better, offer the arrant nonsense that cigarettes are not a health threat. was actually addressed to Dr. Hockett and was in reaction to Dr. Hockett's saying that the problem that industry has in reducing the carcinogenicity of cigarettes stems from a definition of what carcinogenicity is. That is, it's not a property but a process, different by species, by sight and by laboratory artifact. Unreported as well, was the comment made to Fred Panzer by Gori that Shubik's outburst would be typical of the reception to a presentation of industry research to the National Cancer Advisory Board.

"A=10 (No. 87) Despite his preference for bilateral negotiations, Yeutter said that the Japanese would have to give in on beef and citrus if both countries were to return to the table. “Tt takes two to tango, and the Japanese negotiators were not tangoing,” 1e said. “I was getting tired of negotiating with myself.” Japanese Offer ‘The trade representative explained that Sato had offered to remove Javanese quotas on beef over three years, increasing the quota levels—to let in more goods—by 10 perceni annually, and then eliminating them entirely in the fifth year. For citrus, the Japa- nese had offered to remove quotas after five years. ‘Yeutter explained tat the United States would have been willing to accep: the three-year removal of beef quotas, but that the Japanese had also wanted to impose a type of import surcharge on US. beef in exchange for the tariff removal. Yeutter said he could not accept this offer, because although the quotas would be removed, the price constraints “could be just as onerous” as what was originally in place, he said, With regard to citras, Yeutter said that he was not willing to accept a f've-year tariff removal without compensation for the U.S. citrus industry. “What we had offered was two years, with anything over that including a patience payment,” which, he explained is a compensatory payinent agreed to prior to a GATT. ruling. “We felt that live years was far too long,” he added. At the press confcrence, Agriculture Department officials circulated a statement from Agriculture Sec- retary Richard Lyng, who is currently in Fallbrook, Calif. In the statement, Lyng said that he was “extemely disappoint>d” that. an agreement had not. been reached, and tiat he had supported Yeutter's| efforts toward a resolution.) : Advertising HEALTH OFFICIALS URGE CONGRESS TO RESTRICT CIGARETTE ADVERTISING; CHARGE DECEPTION Representatives. of “public health groups. May 4 urged a House subconnittee to push ahead with pro- posed legislation (HR 1532, HR 3294) to restrict or ban cigarette advertising, charging that ads for low-tar and low-nicotine produets are deceptive. . ‘Tobacco companies ‘are consciously deceiving the public by using their advertising to lull smokers into believing that so-calle4 “light” cigarettes— those con- taining lower levels of tar and nicotine—are safe.to smoke although there is no medical evidence that light cigarettes pose less uf a health hazard, the public health officials charged. . “Consumers who pii:chase low-tar and low-nicotine cigarettes believing that they are substantially redue- ing their risk of heart disease, chronic obstructive lung disease or cance are seriously mistaken,” said Dr. Alfred Munzer..oi the Coalition on Smoking or Health—composed of the American Heart Associ- REGULATION, ECONOMICS AND LAW (DER) 5-5-88 ation, American Lung Association, and American Can- cer Society—told the House Energy and Commerce Transportation, ‘Tourism, and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee. “Advertisements which promote these cigarettes, directly or indirectly, as significantly safer alternatives, are patently false.” ° Dr. Robert E. Medfee, of the American Medical Association, noted that while tobacco companies are touting the health benefits of light cigarettes in their advertising, medical studies show many smokers of light cigareites end up getting about the same doses of tar and nicotine as smokers of regular cigarettes because they tend to inhale more deeply and smoke more cigarettes. “There is no safe cigarette and no safe level of tobacco consumption,” he said McAfee charged that advertisements for light ciga- rettes are confusing, if not outright deceptive. For ‘example, he said, cigarette makers use such labelling terms as “low tar,” “lower tar,” “ultra low tar,"" “lights”, and “ultra’ lights” which are industry desig- nations with no legal or medical meaning. Such terms are “misleading and are applied to many brands ‘which do not provide lower doses of tar and nicotine,” he said. Scott D. Ballin, vice president for public affairs for the Coalition on Smoking or Health, charged that the Federal Trade Commission has failed: to take action against deceptive low tar and nicotine advertise- ments. Ballin said that the coalition supports HR 3294, which’ would require “that cigarette ‘advertising be regulated under Food and Drug Administration mat Keting guidelines for legal drugs."" - me FTC Testimony Consumers are better served:by an unregulated advertising environment, since they are likely to bs exposed to more information that way, FC Chairman Daniel Oliver argued. As long as the information on tar and nicotine content is accurate, advertisements promoting light cigarettes “can be a’ valuable source of information to consumers,” he said. If the advertis- ing is deceptive, the FTC will take action against the company, he added."" we Subcommittee chairman Rep. Thomas Luken (D- Ohio) and ranking minority. member Bob Whittaker (R-Kan)—who previously introduced HR 3294 and HR* 1582, which would impose a total ban on cigarette advertising—said that they are working on another bill which would allow states to'require more strin- gent health warnings than federal law ‘requires. Tt ‘would also. permit plaintiffs: to bring” suit against cigarette companies even if the companies complied with federal warnings and it would require the FTC to contract with either a government or private labora- tory to conduct annual studies of tar and nicotine levels, The laboratory would also collect data on the average levels of other: chemicals commonly found in cigarettes, including carbon monoxide, ammonia, cya- nide, formaldehyde, and radioactive compounds. The representatives expect to introduce the bill, which is still being drafted, this week.C] CCopyiight © 1988 by THE BUREAU OF NATIONAL AFFAIRS, INC., Washington, 0.6. 20087 or4e-3155/89/800.50 TIMN 0061655",9

From the outset of the negotiations, it was generally agreed by all participants that a necessary component of any legislation Congress might uhimately pass implementing the proposed resolution of June 20, 1997, must be one designed to relieve various adverse economic impacts that might result for tobacco growers. You may be sure that the tobacco industry never thought legislation should or could pass that did not address the legitimate and important concerns of tobacco growers. Indeed, throughout the negotiations, the industry raised the issue of the impact of the discussions on those who grow tobacco. As you know, since the growers ‘were not parties to any of the pending lawsuits against the industry, they were not represented at the negotiating table. I don’t believe that any of us felt comfortable in trying to deal with these concerns without advice from the growers. ‘Near the very end of the negotiations, a representative of the public health community did propose that the industry provide payments to the growers for the sole purpose of providing financial incentives to them to raise alternate crops. Believing that growers would be offended by such 2 proposal, the industry suggested a counter proposal which would have provided more funding for the existing tobacco program. That counter proposal was rejected. It was then decided that the proposed resolution would not attempt to address issues concerning growers. All parties agreed to work during the legislative process with growers, the Administration and e Congress to find a satisfactory solution to grower concerns. sozézet90z Since June 20, there has been progress toward identifying grower concems and discussing",0

The binding of Moab 159.53 «0 guinea pig melanoma cells was partially intiiced by tetidoypie Mobs MF9-10 and MKI-I80 which recognize distinet oat idiacopes within the antigen combining sie of MoAb 149.53.

These compounds ‘exaped from the filter by entrapment in nontered ‘serosal particles (3). The awthod asad to investigate this phenomenon was to add a Ciabeled compound to a ler, smoke the cigarettes, and measure the amount of Ctlabeled compounds that escaped from the iter (3). Tis method does not accurately simulate lation conditions since the Cisbeled compounds were not filtered from cigarette smoke but were added to the Biter before the cigarette was smoked.

This would make it possible to extend the work hfe despite physical decrement with age. A third effect is an increase in consumer goods, socioeconomic status, and standard of living all of which tend to improve health and longevity.

Box $890, Albugeergue, New Mexico 6718S INTRODUCTION ‘The health effects of diesel exhaust (DE) have been 2 focus of intensive research during the last decade. Increased use of diesel engines in light-duty passenger ears and vans stimulated this research, These vehicles are used ‘extensively in populated areas snd thus could increase the exposure of urban ""residents to DE. Diesel engine-powered vehicles emit moce oxides of nitrogen end some 30 {0 100 times more panicles than do gatoline engines with contemporary ‘emission-control devices. The small size of diesel exhaust particles (DEP) ‘makes them readily respirable, which raises concem for their health effets, As early as 1955, Ketin etal (1) evalusted the chemical composition of diesel ‘exhaust particle extracts (DEPE) and demonstrated their carcinogenicity in rmouse-skin-painting studies. However, litle addtional research was done on DE until the mid-1970s, when advances in biology provided improved methods such as the Ames Salmonella typhimurium aesay (2) for detecting mutagenicity and, potentially, careinogeniity. In 1977 the US Environmental Protection Ageney issued a precautionary notice (3) reporting thet DEPE were mutagenic in bacterial assays. These findings were subsequently published by Huisingh et al (4). This observed mutagenicity wiggered a major research effort on the health effects of DE. The results of this research have been the topic of several symposia and reviews (5-11), and are briefly reviewed in this ancl.

"THE NONLINEAR DOSE-RESPONSE HYPOTHESIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE CJ Smith', TH Fischer’, $ B Sears’ and J C Walker! 'R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, USA University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA. ABSTRACT ‘The hypothesis that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) increases risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in nonsmokers has recently received attention because of two published government reports. Epidemiology studies report that the relative risk for CVD associated with actively smoking twenty cigarettes per day is 1.78. Active smoking exposes the smoker to approximately 16 times the ETS concentration, and 100 to 300- fold the total smoke dose, experienced by @ nonsmoker. These government reports estimate the relative risk for ischemic heart disease in ETS-exposed nonsmokers at 1.30 (CALEPA) and 1.23 (SCOTH), despite the much lower smoke exposure. Platelet aggregation is proposed as a plausible and quantitatively consistent mechanism to explain this nonlinear dose-response anomaly. Herein, evidence is presented suggesting that this low-dose hypothesis is inconsistent with the literature on the cardiovascular pathology of active smoking, the physiology of platelets and with the results from a human exposure chamber study. INTRODUCTION The development or exacerbation of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been called the most scrious health effect allegedly associated with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure in nonsmokers, ‘The California Environmental Protection Agency (CALEPA) has estimated that approximately 47,500 CVD deaths occur in the U.S. each year due to TS exposure [1]. The U.S. EPA’s estimate for U.S. lung cancer deaths associated with ETSis 3,800 (2). ‘The magnitude of the epidemiological association between CVD and active cigarette smoking is problematic for proponents of a causal association between ETS exposure and CVD. Specifically, the relative risk (RR) of CVD in active smokers of twenty cigarettes, per day (one pack) is reportedly 1.78 [3]. Recent relative risk estimates for CVD and ETS include 1,30, as calculated by the California Environmental Protection Agency (CALEPA) [1], and 1.23, as determined by the Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health (SCOTH) [4] in the U.K. According to these estimates, the CVD risk associated with ETS exposure is approximately one-third of the CVD risk associated with actively smoking twenty cigarettes per day. 6zOb LEles RJRO000000001 106746. 70050 7007",2

Thirty-eight non- overlapping unique cDNA fragments were identified in this region, Twenty-two of the selected cDNAs showed complete identity with known genes and expressed sequence tags. Two of these cDNAs shared sequence homology with genes known to encode potential DNA binding motifs and hence could function in transerip- tional “regulation, The remaining 16 unique eDNA fragments showed no significant similarity to sequences in the databases and could potentially encode novel genes. Northern analysis of the novel CDNAS showed differential expression in various tissues, supporting the ‘transcribed nature of these sequences, Our results place the gene for a G-protein coupled receptor (GPR2) previously mapped to 17q within a 400 kb region on 172i. Keywords: cDNA; hybridization selection; BRCAL locus; expressed sequences Breast cancer affects more than 170 000 individuals per year in the US and is one of the leading cause of ‘cancer deaths among women. Besides environmental and other factors, genetic predisposition has been shown to be an important component in the etiology of breast cancer, accounting for about 5% of all cases (Claus et al, 1991), Familial early onset breast and ovarian cancers in some families has been mapped to a susceptibility gene on the long arm of chromosome 17 (Hall er al, 1990), known as breast cancer 1 gene {BRCA 1). Genetic analysis of meiotic recombinants in large Kindreds narrowed down the susceptibility locus to a region of approximately 1 to 2 mega bases on Y7qi2-21, flanked by markers DI7S776 and D17S78 (Bowcock et al, 1993). BRCAL was subsequently cloned (Miki e”’ al, 1994) by applying positional cloning strategies. Mutational analysis of the gene showed that the DNA sequence was altered in family members with long linkage to I7q markers. However, in three of the cight putative BRCAI kindreds potential predisposing mutations were not found (Miki et a, 1994). Mutations in BRCAL have now been confirmed in several additional families (Castiia et al, 1994; Friedman et al., 1994; Simard et al, 1994), ‘Correspondence: R Kandpal Received § April 1995; revised 2 June 1995; acepted 2 Juse 1995 Sporadic cases of breast cancer also involve genetic alterations at various chromosomal loci including regions of 17g, The BRCAI region displays LOH in 30-70% of sporadic breast and ovarian cancers (Euiceal et a, 1992; Jacobs et al., 1993; Cropp et al., 1994). Futreai er al. (19942,b) performed an extensive mutational analysis of the BRCAI coding region in primary breast and ovarian tumors which showed allelic loss at chromosome 17421. Surprisingly only four of the 44 tumors studied were found to contain & mutation and in all cases the mutations were shown to bbe germline. On the basis of these results they suggested that there could be a fundamental difference between the origin or sporadic tumors and those in genetically predisposed BRCA1 carriers. The low frequency of somatic mutations in sporadic cases raised some suspicion as to the role of BRCA\ in the great majority of breast cancers and suggested the possiblity of yet another suppressor gene within the 17q21 region, but outside the BRCAI locus (Vogelstein and Kinzler, 1994). These recent findings underscore the need to search for the presence of other tumor susceptibility genes within this chromosomal region Several methods are currently available for isolating expressed sequences from genomic regions. Of these methods cDNA selection (Lovett et al., 1991; Parimoo et al,, 1991) is one of the most direct and least ambiguous, It involves the immobilization of target DNAS, isolated from YAC, phage or cosmid clones, on ‘a solid support and hybridixation with a pool of eDNAS followed by PCR amplification of the hybrid. selected material. Other method such as exon trapping (Buckler er al., 1991), HTF islfind rescue (Patel et al. 1991) and sequence conservation (Sulston et al, 1992) have been successfully used for isolating gene fragments. In the present study, which was underway at the time of BRCAL cloning, we have analysed the region proximal to and flanking the BRCAI locus for transcribed sequences using direct cDNA selection with a pool of short fragment cDNA libraries from adult brain, adult testis, etal brain, spleen, thymus and total fetus. Four overlapping YACs spanning a total of approximately 470 kb of genomic DNA were used as target to isolate more than 38 cDNA fragments. Our results indicate 16 of these cDNAs to encode fragments of novel genes, some of which are differentially expressed in various tissues. Preparation of genomic DNA YAC DNA and short- fragment cDNA libraries Genomic DNA was isolated from a human lympho- blastoid cell line (J¥) using standard techniques. Four »",6

(When I put a comment in quotation marks, that doesn't mean it's a verbatim comment. I'm just trying to sum up their point of view in a sentence or two.) Arizona Phil McDonald believes there may be an opportunity to include reasonable restaurant smoking language in a bill next year. He is quite certain an initiative would not be a good idea. ""You would need to deliver 200,000 signatures by July of 2000, and the first financial report would come out in January of 2000. When the first financial report hits, the issue will become the tobacco companies’ role in the initiative, and you're radioactive.""

"PHILIP MORRIS AB. Translation ya Norrlandl, Sweden 29.12.1977 _ Labor Unions Agree: Do not Put _a Ban on Tobacco Advertising Do not put a ban on tobacco advertising! This would just promote our foreign competitors. Above this it is now proved that people do not smoke less when advertising’ ceases to exist. These facts are stated by the four labour uni- ons representing the employers within the STA. In a letter to all members of the Parliament they give their opinion on the “to be or not to be"" of the tobacco advertising in Sweden. This letter is, among others, signed by Lennart Kallstrém, Harnésand, who is’a representative of the Swedish Food Labor Union - the biggest labor union within the STA. A lot of people believe that advertising makes people smoke more and that a prohibition of to- bacco ads willl lower the consumption, it says in the letter. Not _less That is wrong! Italy and Norway have already put a ban on advertising and by studying the de- velopment in these countries we will find only one thing: imported cigarettes take the market from the domestic ones. People donot smoke less at all. We cannot accept laws that only would strike against the Swedish state owned company and by this deprive us of employment chances, state the four different labor unions, which have signed the letter.

"(Date! Name Addrese address Dear Name: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OsHA) is currently considering workplace smoking regulations that, if enacted, would virtually ban smoking at all indoor worksites -- including Philip Morris U.S.A. Under this proposal, employers would only be able to accommodate smokers if they constructed separate smoking rooms with completely separate ventilation systems. Advocates of these new rules are well aware that most employers cannot afford to provide separately ventilated smoking rooms, and that the proposed rules actually constitute a nationwide workplace smoking ban. Even more troubling, OSHA's definition of ""workplace"" is so broad it encompasses almost any indoor location where an employee is present -- including your own home if you employ a plumber to fix your sink. Other ""workplaces"" where smoking would be banned include all restaurants, bars, hotel rooms, private offices and company vehicles. Smoking would not even be allowed in a room rented for a private party or function. Fortunately, there is still an opportunity to amend or even prevent the proposed workplace smoking rules. From now until August 13, OSHA will accept public comment on the workplace smoking ban. To have your comments entered into the official OSEA file on this issue, please follow these three simple steps: 1. Take a few minutes to write a brief letter telling OSHA that designated smoking areas are preferable to the severe restrictions now being considered; 2. Make three copies of your letter (this is to comply with federal law; 3. Put your original letter, along with the three copies inside one envelope and mail to: OSHA Docket Docket No. H-122 4660828202",0

"September 20, 1984 TO: J. R. Shostak RE: SALEM Light 85 Product Action Standard Recommendation The current FFLIM85 competitive action standard smoker group reflects share development of 60% heavy smokers (those smokers desiring a high strength delivery cigarette), 40% lighter smokers (those smokers desiring a lighter strength delivery cigarette). Brand/MDD/R&D concur that the competitive smoker group should be reoriented to 70% lighter smokers, 30% heavier smokers, placing a greater priority on the wants of lighter smokers. Implementing this will enable Brand R&D to implement more single- minded and aggressive development of superior products, overcoming the current impasse due to divergent product wants among franchise and competitive smokers. Background/Purpose Recent testing/analysis on Lights 85's suggests divergent wants between 18-34 FFLTM85 competitive smokers of light brands (Merit, Belair, Generics) and heavier brand (Kool Lights, Kool Milds, Newport Lights, VANTAGE) as well as the SALEM Lights 85 franchise smokers. Note: ‘Newport Lights has been grouped inthis category based on smoker panel judgement as the product's ventilation system does not enable accurate competitive product testing. (See Attachment I.) This document reviews the wants of each smoker group to assess the actionability of the current action standard. Current Action Standard Current Performance - . Supériority versus Merit Menthol 85 among Parity 18-34 year old FFLTIM/85MM competitive smokers (60% heavy/40% light). - superiority versus Merit Menthol 85 among Superiority franchise 18+ smokers. Findings/Rationale - Analysis of the data indicates significant differences exist among the three smoker groups, most dramatically the franchise and lighter smokers versus heavier smokers, making the action standard essentially unattainable. Achieving superiority among competitive smokers makes superiority among the franchise unattainable (and vice versa) posing significant franchise risk to a 1.93 share style. (See Attachment II.)

"ATHOL, MASS. NEWS 2-8-69 tgs t ‘Cigarette Ads “The Federal Communications Com. mission would like to bar cigarette adver- tising from television and radio, By a six + to one vote, the commission adopted a regulation banning the advertising and it will become effective unless Congress al- lows the present labelling provision to lapse on July 7. ‘The commission holds power over TV and radio because of the necessity for licensing. Both use the public airways and have exclusive rights to assigned chan- nels in their own territories. They are, therefore, not ‘in the same position as newspapers and other publications, which hhave no such exclusive rights and do not . make use of public property, Nevertheless, since TV and radio are allowed to carry advertising, and since ‘cigarettes are legal, the commission's posi- tion is unsound. It should be possible to ad. vertise anything that can be legally of- fered for sa‘e. On a selfish basis, newspapers. might be inclinea to approve the commission's ban, Television took in about 264 million dollars from cigarette manufacturers last year and newspaper income from them hhas declined to a dribble, But the prin. ciple involved is more important than... lars. If the FOC is so desperately concern. ed about the use of cigarettes, it should Propose that ail sale of them ke prohibited. 50852110 2-8-69 | Cigaret Advertising Congress in 1985 authorized the Federal Trade Commission to print ‘a health warning notice on every package of cigarets sold. At the same time, as a sop to the tobacco Industry, it ordered there should be no restrictions on cigaret advertising until June 30, 1969. ‘That date is now approaching. The Issue is joined by the fact the Fed- eral Communications Commission has proposed the complete ban of radio and television advertising, if Congress lets it have authority in this field. So another battle royal will be Joined in coming weeks. The good guys will argue that since cigarets have been proved a serious health menace, the advertising of them ‘over broadcast media should be halt- ed to keep the young in particular from being enticed. ‘The bad guys will refute the charge as best they can. Cigaret advertisers provide the broadcasters with sev- eral hundred million dollars annual- ly, and this they are not going to give up willingly. The broadcasters have other fac- tors working in their favor. Several members of Congress have radio or ‘TV interests. Still more have close personal friends and campaign con- tributors among big names in the world. There is a conflict of interest here, but it will be resolved in fa- vor of the status quo. Unless the public becomes much more concerned about this matter than it yet has been, the bad guys are much more likely to prevail.

"“Cleaner.” The New Choice For Smokers. In the 1950s, America’s new choice was /tered smoke. By the 1970s, many of us preferred our smoke Hight. Today marks the introduction of cleaner smoke. And a new era for smokers is about to begin. It will revolutionize smoking. Incredible as it sounds, this is the first cigarette you actually smoke by heating tobacco, @ burning tt. It’s a breakthrough that changes the very composition of cigarette smoke — substan- tally reducing many of the controversial compounds found in the smoke of tobacco-burning cigarettes. Those that remain include carbon monoxide, but it’s at a level no greater than in the best-selling “lights” Quite simply, it’s a breakthrough for everyone who smokes. Cleaner smoke. Cleaner pleasure. From your very first pull this ‘will treat you to a smoother smoke than you've ever experienced, Smoke that feels full, but not at all heavy. Smoke that satisfies, yet dissi- pates almost the moment you exhale. Smoke with a cleaner taste, a cleaner aroma, a cleaner feel. And since the tobacco doesn’t burn, the cigarette doesn’t burn down, so there’s no loose ash to flick and - after a puff or two - virtually no smoke from the lit end, If all this sounds too good to be true, prove it to yourself.

"The Biosynthesis of Membrane-derived Oligosaccharides A MEMBRANE-BOUND PHOSPHOGLYCEROI. Barbara J. Jackson and Bugene P. Kennedy} (Mteceive for publication, September 21982) From the Department of Biological Chemistry, Harvard Medical Sol, Huston, Massachusetts 02118 ved oligosnecharides, found in the Escherichia coli periplasmic space (Schulman, Hund Kennedy, B. P. (1979) J. Bacteriol. 137, 686-688), are composed of 8-10 units of glucose, the sole sugar, in 3-2 and fil-+6 linkages (Schneider, J. F., Reinhold, \., Rumley, M. K., and Kennedy, E. P. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 10135-10188). Oligosaccharides in this fam- ily are variously substituted with succinyl ester resi- dues, ax well as with 6n-I-phosphoglycerol and phosphocthanolamine, both derived from membrane Phospholipids. These negatively charged oligoxwecha- Fides may function in cellular osmoregulation since their evnthesis is under osmotic control (Kennedy, P. (1982) Proc. Na U.S. A. 79, 1092-1095). ‘We now report initial characterization of an enzyme catalyzing transfer of phosphoglycerol residuee from phosphatidylglycerol to membrane-derived oligosuc- charides or to synthetic f-glucoside acceptors. The products are en-1,2-diglyceride and f-glucoside-6-phos phoglyeerol.

Entomology AL Beetle Control (Hutchens) Kabat Project Nine Hazard Communication Training presentations on products for insect control have been given to 109 employees at the Davie stemmery and storage facilities. These presentations, requested by Leaf Processing and Storage management, were made to permanent and temporary workers on both shifts. Time involved, including travel, has been approximately ten hours. We feel that this education has been necessary due to concern of personnel regarding Kabat application on tobacco being processed in the stemmery. Except for an occasional visit to discuss individual questions, training at Davie is complete. Approximately 30 permanent storage employees at Brook Cove have attended two presentations. Al] other regular and seasonal employees on each shift will receive this training as soon as possible. Names of persons attending these eleven sessions have been sent to Environmental Engineering. RORTI_ Projects Tobacco destined for Malaysia, Switzerland, and Egypt is now being fumigated at our Durham storage facility. This product has been stored for several months at Piedmont Leaf Tobacco Company in an area known to have beetles in monitoring traps and infestation in cases of cut filler. We are fumigating to lessen the possibility of sending the infestation to the country of destination. Concen- tration of fumigant in poly-lined cases 1s being monitored to determine length of time required for aeration before shipment.

The reference cigarette wrappers are treated to produce cigarette ash with different strengths and colors. LOW SIDESTREAM TEAM SCREENING STUDIES Chalk samples and samples of the Kimberly-Clark (K-C) base papers used to produce all fifteen samples for the Screening Study arrived this week. Analyses will be conducted on all samples to confirm K-C measurements. Additional data that may be used to correlate RJR Phobos permeability readings with Coresta permeability readings made in Roswell has been received along with a more complete tabulation of the characteristics of the base and treated papers prepared for the ng Study (basis weight, permeability, chemical level, filler The first set of Screening Study samples was produced in the R&D Plant on August 24-26, 1988. All products were prepared on the 6-8-6 maker and had a 20.0mm finished circumference. Six prototypes were prepared with Ecusta papers; the remaining prototypes were made with Kimberly-Clark papers. Constant tobacco rod packing density at a high and a low level was achieved with blends containing 10% and 50% expanded tobacco. All samples were produced successfully at target weight and circumference. Given the complexity of the experimental design, successful execution of this portion of the test is a great accomplishment. It is largely due to the care exercised in setting ranges within the experimental design (the work of T. A. Perfetti), excellent cooperation from all staff in the R&D Plant, and the outstanding effort, expertise, and diligence of Mr. William Lane and Mr. Wayne Nelson in making the products. 6109 6690S",0

Boman* The University of Texas M..D, Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute at Houston, Section of Gastrointestinal Oncology and Digestive Diseases, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas 77030 Received December 0, 1987 Matched normal/tumor DNA pairs from sporadic colon carcinoma patients were examined for chromosome 5 allele loss using a probe for a functional gene (glucocorticoid receptor=GRL) locus. This locus maps (5Sgll-ql3) close to one of two alternative sites recently reported for a constitutional deletion in a familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patient. Tumor-specific allele loss of at least 27% at GRE supports the hypothesis that both hereditary and sporadic forms of colon cancer result from mutations of the same gene. The proximity of the GRL locus to the region of 5q affected in FAP and the observed tumor-specific allele loss at this locus suggest that further research is needed regarding whether genetic alterations in the glucocorticoid receptor may be associated with colon carcinogenesis. © 1s acssone press, ine on the basis of the clinical genetic features of hereditary vs. sporadic forms of colorectal cancer (1) we suspected that both forms of this disease might result from mutations of the same gene caused by a two-step mechanism similar to that which occurs in the etiology of retinoblastoma and Wilms' tumors (2).

VERNON E, STEELE, DANIEL L, MORGAN, JON C, NIXON, JOAN £, HUMPHREYS, AND GARY E, HATCH* Northrop Services, Inc. and *U.3. EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC USA ‘The purpose of this study is to develop a quantitative extrapolation model. for determining human risk from experimental aninal data for inhaled toxicants. To provide the tissue sensitivity data necessary for the model, dose response curves will be compared for animal cells exposed in vivo and in vitro and for human cells exposed in vitro. Both rat and hunan nasal turbinate epithelial (NTE) cells were isolated Erom fresh, normal tissue. Cadmium sulfate toxicity was compared between human and Fischer 344 cat NTE cells exposed for 2 hr. in vitro. The initial cytotoxicity endpoint for these studies is energy charge, @ ratio of adenine nucleotide phosphate pools as measured by reverse-phase Liquid chromatography. Cadmium sulfate exposure of rat and human NTE cells in vitto caused a consistent decline in energy charge with time, In cultured tuman NTE cells, cadwium exposure caused a decrease in net energy charge from 0.79 to 0.31, while in rat NTE cells this decline was significantly less (0.81- 0.45). Parallel studies, using nose-only cadmium aerosol exposure, were per~ formed to deteraine the relationship between in vitro and in vivo exposure. While Little change in energy charge was seen in initial studies where whole turbinate tissues were isolated following exposure, techniques are currently being developed to isolate che adenine nucleotide phosphatesefrom the cat NTE cells in situ, The results from these studies should permit a quantitative extrapolation of inhaled particulate toxicity data from animals to humans, (This abstract does not necessarily reflect EPA policy).

Pasterczyk Re: A #2 Learning about Com (BIAD #95-11149) From the socond A&A I pulled key evaluative and communication measures about the competitive DM piece alone, the ads alone, and the combination of both among the competitive set. * Overall, the No B.S. DM piece communicated much of the desired imagery at higher levels than the comparable Fabric piece. Specifics include: a brand my friends would smoke, offers advantages over other brands, for person who enjoys simple things in life, a no B.S. person, for ‘a person who does his/her own thing. ‘They were comparable on true to convietions, strong sense of right & wrong, what you see is what you get, and rejects artificiality. + Thokey positive attribute provided by the No B.S. comedy video was peer acceptance (a brand my friends would smoke). Otherwise, it did not do a better job than the ads alone to evoke the feolings desired, Additionally, the synergy of both the DM pices and ads together did not increase the overall communication above cither of the clements separately. This suggests, as ‘we said in the original comedy quantitative study, that while the video registers high on ‘entertainment value it needs to incorporate more of the “meat” associated with the product point of difference. (As you recall, we even wondered if there was some way to adapt the ingredient demonstration portrayed in the Fabric comedy video into the No B.S. format.) + For Fabric, the ""sensory overload"" we have already identified with this campaign along with the alienation brought about by the female midriff executions, resulted in poor scores overall for the ads alone, The video improved purchase intent, importance, difference, and believabilty, apparently based on the ingredient demonstration. Likewise, these same positives for the video alone rubbed off when combined with the ads. The tonality of this video is, judgmentally, more of a problem (ie., lame, borrowed interest). Tnterms of share, the video adds about a tenth of a share point to the share forall campaign approaches. Any questions or to discuss further, please call, Rage cc: B.C, Leary, CS. Nicholson, D.

Box 5827 Winston-Salem, NC 27113 Dear Carol: ‘Amanda sent over the report on circulation shortfalls on October 7. It occurred to me that many of the same titles consistently show up on this list, namely the tabloids. In order to get a good picture of the circulation trend of the three core tabloid titles, | compiled the attached chart using the ABC §-Year Trend Report. The National Enquirer and Star have both lowered their rate base each year over the past five years. Even with the lower rate bases each year, neither has made its rate base since 1991, Globe has not claimed a rate base for the past five years, but its circulation has continued downward much like the Enquirer and Star. In 1994, the circulation dropped only 1% in the Enquirer and 2% in the Star. However, our resident expert on O.J. reminded me that 1994 was the year his wife was murdered and that could contribute to the “less than average’ circulation drop. All kidding aside, | do have major concems about where these books think their circulation will bottom out and why their circulation keeps shrinking. You and | talked earlier this month about your concems about the editorial similarities between the Enquirer and Star. | think that'both of us should have a serious discussion with the reps on their next visit. They always seem to be willing to work us on ‘compensating us on the circulation shortfall, but that it not really the point. In your opinion, where do you think this circulation is going? Is the potential audience {or tabloids shrinking, thus the books are getting a piece of a smaller pie? Do you think they might be going to other tities, or other mediums? As | said, | have a real concem about the continued loss of circulation, and am not unhappy that DORAL will be using only one of the titles next year. This 5-Year Trend Report was a real eye opener for me. Perhaps we would be wise to look at this circulation trend when we are coming down to choosing between very similar tiles in the same field. It could be an indication of the circulation vitality, whether it is in a particular category, such as the tabloid, or the strength of one title in a field over another. ugen 9Lezs",0

"TO: Dr. Lawrence FROM: Fred Best WEEKLY HIGHLIGHTS AUGUST 1 - 7, 1989 * Radiotracer study to compare the fates of glycerol in smoke of Beta 90 protocepts, 423727A & B, is underway. Smokings, ° quadruplicate runs with each set, have been completed and data are presented in the attached Table. These data indicate that glycerol delivers well from these products. The glycerol transfer efficiency is about double that from a WINSTON KS cigarette (19% compared to 10%). There appear to be no statistically significant differences between glycerol’s fates in these 2 products. : Statistical analysis of the data and determination of intact glycerol content remain to be done. Previous studies (WINSTON KS) indicate that about 94% of the MSTPM radioactivity is due to intact glycerol. As with the nicotine data reported earlier, distribution to MS is increased and distribution to SS is decreased resulting in a lower SS/MS ratio of about 2 compared to about 4 for WINSTON KS. Sacrifice and radioassay points indicate very low levels, less than 1%, have migrated to the carbon plug. Migration measurements will continue for 2 more weeks. * The Cahn Recording Balance to be used for assessment of .flavor volatility has been received. Installation and setup have begun. STS beetg",0

Wy opinion is that those who fight smoking are the ones who publish their convictions like :prephets in their faith, Those who are not convineed are to lazy to write a paper.

"Homophilic Binding of PTPy, a Receptor-Type Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Can Mediate Cell-Cell Aggregation ‘Susann M. Brady-Kalnay, Andrew J. Flint, and Nicholas K, Tonks (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724-2208 Abstract. The receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphe- tase, PTPy, displays structural similarity to cell-cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfam- ily. We have investigated the ability of human PTPy to function in such a capacity. Expression of PTPy, with ‘or without the PTPase domains, by recombinant baculovirus infection of Sf9 cells induced their aggre- gation, However, neither a chimeric form of PTPy., containing the extracellular and transmembrane seg- ‘ments of the EGF receptor and the intracellular seg- ‘ment of PTPy, nor the intracellular segment of PTPy expressed as a soluble protein induced aggregation PTPy mediates aggregation via a homophilic mecha- nism, as judged by lack of incorporation of uninfected ‘9 cells into aggregates of PTPh-expressing cells Homophilic binding has been demonstrated between PTPy-costed fluorescent beads (Covaspheres) and en- dogenously expressed PTPs: on MvLu cells. Addition- ally the PTPu-coated beads specifically bound to a bacterially expressed glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein containing the extracellular segment of PTPy. (GSTIPTPy) adsorbed to petri dishes. Covaspheres coated with the GST/PTPx. fusion protein aggregated in vitro and also bound to PTPy expressed en- dogenously on MvLu cells. These results suggest that the ligand for this transmembrane PTPase is another PTPy molecule on an adjacent cell. Thus homophilic binding interactions may be an important component of the function of PTPy in vivo. proteins is an essential component of the modulation ‘of signal transduction processes involved in cell ‘growth and differentiation. The dynamic balance of cellular phosphotyrosine levels is achieved by the opposing actions of the protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs): and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). The PTKs are a structurally di- ‘verse group that includes growth factor receptors and a sub- stantial number of oncogene products, including members of the sre family. It is now apparent that PTPases rival the PTKs in structural diversity and complexity. PTPases have the potential to oppose the effects of kinases as illustrated by their ability to suppress the transforming potential of onco- genic PTKs (Brown-Shimer et al., 1992; Woodford-Thomas et al., 1992; Zander et al., 1993). However, the PTPases should not be viewed simply as PTK antagonists. Overex- pression of PTPa leads to dephosphorylation and activation of e-sre and induces cell transformation (Zheng etal., 1992). In addition, CD4S has been showa to play an essential role in signal transduction through the T cell receptor, also poten- tially exerting its effect through the dephosphorylation and activation of sre-amily PTKs such as fck and fin (reviewed Te reversible phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues in ‘Riess corespondence to N.K.

Current evidence clearly indicates an essential role for the PTPases in cellular signaling PTPases exist in both soluble and transmembrane, re- cceptor-like forms, (Charbonneau and Tonks, 1992). ""The structural features of some of the enzymes suggest a role for subcellular localization in the regulation of activity, In the ‘case ofthe receptor PTPases, similar to the receptor PTKs, there is the potential for regulating activity by the binding of ligands to the extracellular segment of the protein. Several of the transmembrane PTPases are members of the immuno- globulin superfamily and display structural motifs in their extracellular segments that are suggestive of a role in cell-cell adhesion (Streuli et al., 1989; Fischer etal, 1991), Cell-cell adhesion molecules are grouped into two major families on the basis of homology and conditions for bind- ing: the immunoglobulin superfamily (generally calcium- independent) and the cadherin family (caleium-dependen} N-CAM is prototypical ofthe immunoglobulin superfamily ‘of adhesion molecules. It contains five immunoglobulin do- mains and two fibronectin type-II repeats in the extracellu- lar segment (reviewed by Edelman and Crossin, 1991), ‘Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion mole- cules that associate with the actin cytoskeleton by interac- tions of their cytoplasmic domains with proteins termed ‘catenins (Ozawa et al., 1989).

Rosecrans' w a gegen HN et rer wile fa ‘COPYRIGHT HOLDER Ee ee ea Scoot ‘Nicotine, the presumed active pharmacological agent in tobacco, produces variable effects fon behavior that are at best described as “‘paradoxical""” in nature, Thus, nicotine, via tobacco use in humans or nicotine administration in experimental animals, tends to trans- pose behavior depending on predrug baseline rates of behavior. High rates of behavior appear to be reduced, while low rates of behavior appear to be increased by nicotine. This work further proposes that nicotine’s variable effects on behavior may be related to its capacity to act as a behavioral agonist and/or antagonist via its ability either to activate or to desensitize distinct central nicotinic acetyleholinergic receptors (nACHR's). ‘Nicotine is portrayed as a neuronal modulating agent that can affect behavior contingent uupon the genetic makeup of the individual subject being studied. Depending on the structure, function, and location of distinct mAChR’s, nicotine appears to be able to induce 1 wide range of behavioral effects important to the tobacco user. However, this does not rule out the role the importance that other biogenic amine systems (j.e., serotonin or dopamine) may have in the genetics of tobacco use or nicotine’s variable effects on behavior. KEY WORDS: Nicotine; smoking; nicotinic receptors; behavior, desensitization; serotonin; ine dividual variabily. INTRODUCTION The use of nicotine via its presence in tobacco has been both engaging and enigmatic to many re- searchers over the last 30 years. Its behavioral ef- fects in man appear to be “paradoxical” in nature (Robinson and Pritchard, 1992), i.e., some individ- uals appear to be aroused by nicotine (via smoking) while others are sedated following similar dosing patterns. Tobacco use has also had an important societal funetion in Native American and West In- dian cultures and has served man well in times of crisis (Klein, 1993). As pointed out by Klein, “‘General Pershing once wrote that they (cigarettes) ""Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Virginia Com- ‘monwealth University, Richmond, Virginis 23298-0615, 187 were as vital to his troops as food.”” Even Shamans in South America have employed tobacco use for centuries as a means of warding off the evil spirits * believed to cause disease in these tribal societies (Wilbert, 1987). Thus, nicotine has a rich phar- macological history of use in man, at least via the use of tobacco. Nicotine’s “paradoxical” nature has also been observed at the molecular level in studies evaluat- ing its effects at the nicotinic acetylcholinergic re- ‘ceptor (nACHR’s). Marks ef al. (1985), for exam- ple, were the first to note that chronic nicotine administration was capable of inducing an up-reg- ulation (increase in the number of receptors) of central nACBR’s. The molecular mechanism of, RACHR up-regulation appears to be related to ni- POSEETISOS",6

Pacey ewe 0884 Lone Come, Autopsy findings link women’s lung cancer rise to alert diagnosis WASHINGTON—Three Yale epidemiologists suggest that ‘women's higher incidence of lung cancer today may be more a reflection of physicians’ diligence in diagnosing it among women who smoke than of the increase in the number of female smokers. But a pulmonary specialist describes their hypothesis as “convoluted reasoning.” ‘The investigators base their theory on the “surprise discovery."" ina 10%-year autopsy review, of nearly equal numbers of men and women with undiagnosed primary Jung cancer. All 3286 autopsies performed on adult patients at Yale-New Haven Hospital between Septem: ber 1971 and May 1982 were included in the study. Dr. Michael J. McFarlane, a Robert Wood Johnson postdoctoral fellow, presented his group's findings at the meeting here of the Association of American Physicians, the American Society for Clinical Investigation, and the American Federation for Clinical Research, ‘Small sample. Acknowledging thatthe sample size was too small for the findings to achieve statistical signifi- cance, Dr. McFarlane—speaking also for co-investigators Drs. Alvan R. Feinstein and Carolyn K. Wells—said, “We ‘elieve that some ofthe recently feported increase in hung. cancer in women may be due to increased detection and that the increased detection may be enhanced by the in- creased number of women who smoke.” Primary lung cancer was found in 152 patients at au- topss, including 108 whose cancers were diagnosed dur- ing life and 43 whose tumors went undetected. Of those with diagnosed lung cancer, 77 were men and 32 were ‘women aratio consistent with the expected hung cancer incidence differential between men and women. Of those with previously undiagnosed hung cancer, 24 were men— for a lung cancer rate of 14.3 per 1,000—and 19 were swomen-—for a rate of 12.7 per 1,000. Of the 43 unexpected auropey reculte, 27 concerned patients who had never had a cancer diagnosis and 16 con ‘cerned cancer patients with unknown or incorrectly iden: tified primary sites. “Our findings clearly contrast the reported rates of hing cancer diagnosed in men and ‘women during life. We can assume that a great deal of lung cancer goes undetected among the general popula. tion, especially among women,” Dr. McFarlane said MEDICAL WORLD NEWSVune 11, 1984 T10447-0795",9

We have examined the expression of germline C, transcripts (,-C, transcripts) in splenic B cells and pre-B cell lines after cytokine and mitogen stimulation. In contrast to the expression of the germline transcripts from downstream C, genes, expression of germline C, transcripts was constitutive and unaffected by mitogen and cytokine treatment. After a primary switch recombination event, the germline |, promoter, which is now associated with a downstream C, gene, continues to be active—leading to the generation of a novel germline transcript consisting of the I, exon spliced to the Cy exons of the switched C, gene. We discuss the potential role of the expression of hybrid |,-containing transcripts in the class switch process.

"Effect of Combined Supplementation With a-Tocopherol, Ascorbate, and Beta Carotene on Low-Density Lipoprotein Oxidation I. Jialal, MD, S.M. Grundy, MD, PaD ‘Background. Data continue to accumulate supporting a proatherogenic role for oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDI). Antioxidant micronutrients such as ascorbate, cctocopherol, and beta carotene, levels of which can be favorably manipulated hy dietary measures without side effects, could be a safe approach in inhibiting LDL oxidation. In fact, in vitro studies have shown that all three antioxidants can inhibit LDL oxidation. The present study was undertaken to ascertain both the safety and antioxidant effect of combined supplementation with a-tocopherol, ascorbate, and beta carotene on LDL oxidation. ‘Methods and Resuls. The effect of combined. supplementation with axtocopherol (800 TU/a) plus ascorbate (1.0 g/d) and beta carotene (30 mg/d) on copper-catalyzed LDL oxidation was tested in a randomized, placebo-controlled study in two groups of 12 male subjects over a 3-month period. Blood samples forthe lipoprotein profile, antioxidant levels, and LDL isolation were obtained at baseline and at 3 months. Nether placebo nor combined antioxidant therapy resulted in any side effects or exerted an Adverse effect on the plasma lipoprotein profil. Compared with placebo, combined antioxidant therapy resulted in a significant increase in plasma ascorbate and lipid standardized a-tocopherol and beta carotene levels (2.6, 41-, and 16.3-fold respectively). At baseline, there were no significant differences in the time course curves and kinetics of LDL oxidation as evidenced by the thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS) assay and the formation of conjugated dienes. However, at 3 months, combined supplementation resulted in a twofold prolongation ofthe lag phase and a 40% decrease in the oxidation rate, The combined antioxidant group was also compared with a group that received 800 TU of ‘tocopherol only. Although the combined antioxidant group had significantly higher ascorbate and bet carotene levels than the group supplemented with a-tocopherol alone, there were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to LDL oxidation kinetics. ‘Conclusions. Combined supplementation with ascorbate beta carotene, and a-tocopherol is not superior to high-dose a-tocopherol alone in inhibiting LDL oxidation. Hence, a-tocopherol therapy should be favored in future coronary prevention trials involving antioxidants. (Circulation. 1993;88:2780 2786.)

"INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM ‘TO: Dr. A. W. Hayes DATE: June 5, 1989 FROM: Paul Nelson SUBJECT: Trip to ASMS conference This year’s American Society for Mass Spectrometry conference was held in Miami Beach from May 21-26. Approximately 1600 attendees were present to examine ~150 oral ‘and =650 poster presentations covering both fundamental aspects and applications of mass spectrometry. I attended the conference from May 21-24, and presented a poster titled “Internal Standard System for Use with APCI Mass Spectrometers."" What follows is a summary of some of the posters, presentations, discussions, and symposia which are or may be relevant to research here at RJR. My poster was on display Wednesday of the conference, and although the use of APCI instruments is somewhat limited, the poster did generate quite a bit of interest. 1 spoke with Donald Kenny of Batelle labs who also operates a TAGA spectrometer and he said that they had been trying to do the same thing for some time now. We also discussed the application of a breath sampler which they designed and have attached to their spectrometer and the potential utility of such a device for monitoring the breath of people following exposure to ETS. This may be a promising area to follow up in this lab some time in the future. The most interesting symposium given during the conference was titled ""Air Monitoring by Mass Spectrometry: Present and Future Perspectives.” Five papers were scheduled during the symposium, but unfortunately, a paper to be presented by Tom Pritchett of Weston React covering the monitoring of air pollutants with a TAGA was cancelled at the last minute. G. Wood of the EPA at Research Triangle discussed the future of EPA guidelines/regulations for industrial emissions. When queried about the + prospect of EPA regulation of indoor environments, his answer was consistent with that | e6pz 00805",0

There is considerable similarity between the configura- tion of target and background which produces maximum cuity degradation and that which produced maximum shiff in the Zollner illusion'*, Thus the vernier lines in this situation are subject to a systematic illusion of tilt. It is nevertheless difficult to see why this should lead to any increase in the variance of the vernier settings, and indeed it is possible to provide an explanation of the Zollner effect in terms of feature detectors'?. Finally, mention should be made of the finding of Ludvigh'* that vernier precision can’ be maintained in a ‘modified form of the vernier task which consists of aligning the ‘middle one of three dots.

Marijuana cigarettes containing 1.8 g of marijuana (UNC 303, 0.67% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) for each cigarette were prepared with the same paper as that for Kentucky Standard tobacco. Experiments were carried’ out on over 1,300 cultures of human Tung explants. For each experiment a minimum of ‘eight sets consisting of twenty-four coverslips with matched ung explants was used. Each set comprised a control culture ‘ot exposed to cigarette smoke, a culture exposed to four puffs per day (25 mi. at intervals of 58 s) of fresh smoke from ‘marijuana cigarettes for 4-10 consecutive days, and a culture ‘exposed in the same manner to two puffs from Kentucky Standard cigarettes. The lower number of puffs from Ken- tucky Standard cigarettes was given because of the relatively high cytotoxic effect of this type of cigarette on the cultures. ‘The larger puff volume of 25 ml., instead of 8 mi. used in the previous study, was chosen because it resembled more closely the standard puff volume of 35 mil. inhaled by human smokers. Media were changed immediately after each exposure. Os99STE00T",6

The poly~ nuclear aromatic hydrocarbons and the weekly actdle phenolic fractions have exhibited tumor-initiating and fumor-promoting characteristies respectively. ‘These studies have been earried out with commercially avail. fable cigarettes, ‘The use of different commercial brands, or even one particular brand employed over a period of time, az x source of the smoke condensate sample makes it very dificult to correlate the results obtained by different laboratories because of the vari- ‘ition in the composition of the blended tobacco and the additives used in making the cigarettes. ""The University of Kentucky Reference (IR1) and the alkaloid sevies cigarettes which were developed to fil the need for standard cigarettes with known smoke composition ean serve ag reference standards for both ehemical and biomedical research.

"Me. C. H. Goldsmith Janvary 26, 1970 F, E. Resnik FTC Gas Phase Letter In reference to the FIC Gas Phase letter of January 9, 1970, I would Like to make the following coments, The PIC letter states the term ""gas phase"" as though it {9 a single component which can be readily measured in the cigarette smoke. Particulate matter is defined as that material from cigarette smoke which is collected on @ Cambridge filter pad, and the gas phase {s defined as that material which pasees ti the Cambridge filter pad. Since the particulate matter is collected on a Canbridge pad, it can readily be weighed and thus a single value determined for a cigarette brand. This is rot the case for gas phase, since there is no established means for collecting and determining a single value for this phase of cigarette smoke. The gas phase of cigarette smoke is composed of over 90% air, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and water, ‘Therefore, to develop methods for determining g28 phase ac defined as that material passing through a Cambridge filter pad would be of little significance, We need to ack the PTC what they mean vith regard to their letter using the phrase, ""gas phase of cigarette exoke"", For your additional inforvation, I am attaching an article published by Liggett & Myers in 1965, in which Table 2 gives come idea of the distribution and composition of the gas phase of cigarette smoke. With regerd to the FTC's request that we list all varieties of cigarettos vhich reduce or in any vay affect the gas phase of cigarette smoke, we should inform them that all our cigarette brands reduce some components of the gas phase of cizerette emoke. An article published by Liggett & Myers thie @onth shows that HCN is reduced by an ordinary CA filter. This 10 illustrated in Table 1 of the attached article. With regard to our advertisements for Multifilter, there are numerous articles in the literature which show selected removal of various gas phase components by the use of a charcoal filter. We should be able to readily cubotantiate our claims from the Literature without any actual documentation of our laboratory results or methodology. There ara many questions to be resolved regarding the methodology to ba used for the analyeis of spreific components in the gas phase of cigarette smoke. In: y opinion, the analyte of gas phase components is going to be considerably more difficult than the analysis of the particulate matter of cigarette umoke. For one reason, total particulate matter io generally Present in milligram amounts per cigarette, whereas specific gee phase componente are present in microgram enounts per cigarette, or 1,000 tines less than total particulate matter. s6Tszezu0$ Twill be happy to discu: this subject with you at your convenience, FER/ael POF wanna",0

Some epidemiologic studies of nonsmokers presum- ably exposed to ETS have suggested a marginal increase of risk for some diseases previously associated with active mainstream smoking (MSS). These reported risks. however, border on statistical and epidemiologic insignificance. and could easily derive from numerous and documented biases and confounders. ‘Official reviews have stopped short of implying a causal role of ETS in most of these associations, with a notable exception for lung cancer. This exception has been based not so much on admittedly questionable epidemiology. but on a public health stance of concern driven by perceived—but largely undocumented—compositional similar- ""To whom correspondence shouldbe addressed. 8 (0273.2300/91 $3.00 ‘apa € 121m Adem Po Ie S9OOLTSHOS",6

I’ve summarized it for our purposes below. © In9 regions, increase the Doral ceiling to $0.30/$3.00 in all outlets. These regions are MWSA, Northern and Southern California, and Seattle. ‘© For all remaining regions, keep the ceiling as is. That is $0.20/$2.00 in all outlets except CO's, where the ceiling is $0.30/83.00. © Make this effective in the data for next Saturday's update.

INTRODUCTION In order to be able to study the disposition of Grug enantiomers in the body, analytical methods are required that permit the analysis of enantiomers ‘The biochemical reactions in living organisms oc- cur on a three-dimensional basis as a result of the asymmetric nature of the macromolecules involved in such reactions. Enantiomers of drugs can be con- verted by the liver enzymes at rates or they can be converted into different metab- lites (I~). As drugs also interfere or participate in the biochemical reactions in the organism, large dif= ferences in pharmacodynamic properties can also bbe obtained for drug enantiomers (5-8).

Concern over the average never smoker's lung cancer risk from exposure to “environ- ‘mental"" tobacco smoke (ETS)has grown considerably since a 1981 study reported an association between ung cancer in nonsmokers and marriage to a smoker Hirayama, 1981). Since then, other epidemiological studies of the association between lung cancer among nonsmokers and ETS exposure from living with ‘smoker have been conducted in Japan (Akiba ¢1 al., 1986), Greece (Trichopoulos et al., 1963), Hong Kong (Chan & Fung, 1982; Koo et al., 1985), Sweden (Per- ‘shagen et al., 1987), Great Britain (Gillis et al., 1984; Lee et al., 1986), and the U.S. (Garfinkel et al., 1981; Correa et al., 1983; Bufflere7 al., 1984; Kabat & Wyn- der, 1984; Garfinkel e7 al., 1985; Dalager e1 al., 1986; Brownson ef al., 1987; and Humble et al., 1987). The “To whom sl correspondence should be addressed results of these studies have been used to estimate an average excess lung cancer risk for never smokers of 30% from ETS exposure (Blot & Fraumeni, 1986; NRC, 1986; Wald et al., 1986; Wigle et al., 1987). Al- termatively, the risk can be estimated by downward ‘extrapolation techniques based on the lung cancer risk for current smokers and the average exposure of cur- rent and never smokers. The former method is a risk- ‘based estimate whereas the latter is an exposure-based estimate. Linear Extrapolation This study uses linear downward extrapolation to ‘estimate the lung cancer risk and the number of U.S. Jung cancer deaths for male and female never smokers in 1980 from exposure to ETS. The final estimate of the number of ETS-attributable never smoker lung ‘cancer deaths requires four preliminary estimates: 1. The number of never smokers at risk, 2. The average tobacco smoke exposure of never smokers, 87597636",6

In general, the results of these endeavours have not been impressive (Schwarz, 1987). In Australia, 85% of current smokers have made anempts to quit (Borland & Hill, 1988). Is clear that most quit anempts end in relapse, Such findings have led to change in research emphasis, with some investigators beginning to focus on relapse episodes (eg. Marat & Gordon, 1980, 1985: Shiffman, 1982; Shiffman & Jarvik, 1987). The aim is t develop methods to reduce the occurrence of relapse. In the process of addressing this goal itis imponant to obtain good descriptive information on the situations in which Cigarenes are smoked after a period of abstinence (called slip-ups inthis paper) or in which temputions occur which are overcome ‘Research into slip-up episodes is of two kinds, those that have provided a multivariate eserition of slip-up context (e.g.. Cummings, Jaen, & Giovino, 1985; Shiffman, 1982) and those that have sed the set of munully exclusive categories developed by Marla and Gordon (1980) (e.g., O'Connell & Martin, 1987). It is difficult to directly compare the wo methods; they will be dealt with separately. Descriptions of slip-up episodes have been collected from both those who recovered from the slip-up but promptly resumed abstinence, tnd those for whom the slip-up represented the beginning ofa relapse.

"Toxicity of Aerosols Introduction [x recent seams there has been a growing concern about the toxicity of aerosol products that are sold for medicinal, per- sonal, or houschold use. The most serious ineidents have been death from the in- halation of acrosol for household use that is collected in a plastic bag, @ dangerous practice which clearly constitutes a mis- use of the product, There is no question that the fatal outcome of this habit is re- lated to the inhalation of acrosol propel- ants that are known to be toxic to the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The potential hazards of aerosols con- taining bronchodilator drugs are diffieult to assess. ‘The therapeutic value of the rug can readily be measured, but the toxicity of the propellants is uncertain, ‘The available information indicates that in animals the inhalation of high eon- centrations of propellants may eause fatal ceardiae arrhythmias, ‘The animals used in these studies do not suffer from broncho- spasm, so that there is a possibility that the presenee of bronchopulmonary dis- case might inerease the sensitivity of the heart to lower concentrations of the pro- pellants.

The concentration of the pro- pellant that is inhaled is lower than that ‘of bronchodilators, because of its dilution by mixture with room air. However, one aerosol product for medication of the room was reported to have caused 21 deaths, and it has been withdrawn from the market, presumably because of the toxicity of the propellant. ‘The remaining group of aerosols for personal use, consisting of hairsprays, Acodorants, and feminine hygiene prod- ets, present a different form of hazard. ‘These are not introduced directly into the air passages but are sprayed on vari- ous parts of the body. The propellants generated from the acrosols for personal use are inhaled at a lower concentra than the other acrosol produets. How. ever, the personal produets are used more frequently than the others There is no adequate information on the toxicity aris- 1g from chronic use of these propellants, This article is intended to review the present state of knowledge on the toxicity of acrosol products.

Zaternatonal Jounal for Pareiology 19: 779-78S. The eects of ascorbate and copper on the development of Plasmodium falciparum were studied in two modes: pretreatment of uninfected erythrocytes followed by infection by P.aliparum and ureaiment of parasitized erythrocytes. Pretreatment of G6PD(+) cells with ascorbate caused a slight enhancement in par development, while in G6PD(—) cell a suppressive effect on the plasmodia was demonstrates. Copper alone interfered with parasite growth in both cel types. The combination of copper and ascorbate eresed parasite maturation, an effect which was more pronounced in GEPD(~) ells. Synergism between copper and ascorbate was better demonstrated following the reatmen of infected erythrocytes: while ascorbate alone supported parasite development and copper alone had only a marginal suppressive effec, the ombination of copper and ascorbate yielded a marked inhibition of paresite growth. Ascorbate proved destructive tothe parasites inthe presence of edventitious copper, or of the second day of the parasite life cycle. In these cases it acted asa pro-oxidant, while in other systems. in particular in the presence of a chelator, ascorbate acied es an antioxidant and promoted parasite growth, The understanding of the role of ‘ransition metals and free radicals in parasite development and injury could shed light on novel approaches to fight malaria INDEX KEY WORDS: Plasmodium falciparum; ascorbic acid; copper; fee radicals; G6PD deficiency. INTRODUCTION ‘Oxtoarive challenge may affect the plasmodia at each of its developmental stages including recognition of host cells, penetration and intracellular development of the parasite (Golenser & Chevion, in press). For example, such a challenge may cause lipid per- oxidation (Stocker, Hunt, Buffinton & Weidemann, 1985) or lead to the formation of methemoglobi (Wozencraft, Dockrell, Taverne, Targett & Playfair, 1984) that, in turn, may interfere with plasmodial growth. Likewise, in vivo studies using the mouse model have indicated that parasitemia is depressed by the oxidant stress-generating xenobiotic alloxan (Clark & Hunt, 1983), The effect of alfoxan could be prevented by prior administration of the potent iron chelator desferrioxamine, These results are in full accord with the proposed catalytic role of transition metals in free radical-induced damage in a variety of biological systems (Chevion, 1988). During the development of the parasite, §To whom all correspondence should be addressed. hemoglobin is digested and a concurrent release of high levels of iron takes place within the red blood cell Ganney, Joist & Fitch, 1988). In this study, we have chosen to use adventitious copper as an exogenous metal in order to allow discrimination between the effects of the endogenous and added metals, Additionally, copper per se is known to act as an ‘oxidant agent on red blood cells (Metz, 1960; Boulard, Blume & Beutler, 1975) even at concentrations compatible to its contamination in the environment (Calebrese, Gary & Soon-Ching, 1980), The effects of copper should be better demonstrated slucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)- deficient erythrocytes which are more sensitive to oxidizing challenge (Friedman, 1979; Roth, Raventos- Suarez, Rinaldi & Nagel, 1983; Golenser, Miller, Spira, Navok & Chevion, 1983). In this investigation wwe have examined the effect of adventitious ascorbate, copper and a chelator (diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid—Detapac) upon the development of P. falciparum in normal and in  G6PD-defcient erythrocytes.

The area of biomedical research concerning a possible relationship between tobacco usage and human disease seems to be one in which good and poor research coexist and in which many questions remain unresolved. Clearly, at this time, all the elements of the lungs’ defense system are not identified or characterized. Further, the influences of a variety of environmental factors (atmospheric pollutants, inhalation anesthetics, drugs, etc.) remain to be defined. On the strength of our previous research activities and interest in cancer and host defense mechanisms, we propose to expand our research activities in the areas of lung defense mechanisms and diseases, including cancer. We intend that the studies directed toward tobacco shall constitute approximately 50 percent of our total research effort in this proposal. Some of the initial research projects in this area include: 1. Determination of the proliferative capacity of pulmonary cells in smokers, in non-smokers, and in patients with various diseases; 2. Characterization of the morphologic and functional parameters of such cells and determination of their maturational sequence; 3. Determination of the capacity for phagocytosis and microbial killing of cells obtained by bronchopulmonary lavage in smokers, non-smokers, patients with lung disease, and patients exposed to various inhalants;",0

"Date: Subjec To: 2071743540 Page 1 Noto for Cully, Liz Briggs, Gary(Kowal) ‘Tue, Aug 20, 1996 5:22 PM Establishment Script Culley, Liz Here's a summary of what I believe has happened with the Establishment and Ambassador scripts at CRI. 1) The scripts I faxed to you are what we believed to be the currently loaded scripts at CRI for both Establishment and Ambassador 2) In discussions with Heather and test calls, I learned thatthe script being used by CSRs on the Establishment and Ambassador lines is exactly the same (and not like what I faxed to you). As you heard when you completed atest call, the CSR is prompted to ask if you are affliated with a Philip Morris Co. or not. Dependent on your answer, the call is either ‘uoated as an Ambassador or Establishment call from that point forward. 3) Neither Peter nor Heather are aware as to why this change was made in the scripting from what was provided to CRI. ‘These changes took place before Heather's time and Kowal’s assuming some responsibility for the Estblishment program. Peter believes that Katrina and Gerry King at CRI worked directly together in implementing these scripts. From ACSR usage standpoint, the current flow is easier than having separate scripts for the different line, Perhaps a decision was made to combine these two scripts to make it easier for CSRs to work with? To be honest, I'm not sure anyone at PM checked to see if what was provided for scripts was what was actually loaded. [ know no one at Kowal did because that ‘was not part of our responsibilities a the time. 4) CSRs should not be asking if you are 21 years of age or older. It does not appear on the screen in front of the CSR. We made that change earlier this year and it has been incorporated by CRI. One CSR told me she asked the question because she felt it was missing from the sereen. She understood that you were always supposed to ask an Accommodation caller if they were 21 years of age or older. It appears that a number of CSRs operate under this myth. asked Peter some of the same questions you asked me. He was very surprised that the calls flowed that way and he remembers only providing separate scripts for each individual line and assumed that they were being programmed that way. - Why didn't Kowal/anyone catch this in quality control? Peter told me that at the time these seripis were writen, it was not in Kowals responsibilities to do this type of work on the Estblishment program. He noted that we did submit a proposal to do similar QA work on the Establishment program, as we were doing on the Consumer program atthe time, but this was not approved and our involvement stayed primarily with the Consumer program. ~ Why didn't we catch this in test calls earlier this year? Aside from the Bill Clinton theory of selective recall (and ""don't ask/don' tell” and, I saw Tm a Democrat but act like a Republican), I have to take some blame here. In doing test calls, which I began in March, 1 ‘guess I assumed that the scripting the CSR was using was what was approved and in the system prior to my time.

This site was cloned from a hyperplastic outgrowth (D2) into lambda phage. A 1.7 Kb Hind Il DNA fragment, which flanks the 5 end of the MMTV insert, was generated from the cloned Int-5 region, This fragment was used as probe (IH.-2) to localize Int-5 to mouse chromosome 9. The IH-2 sequence was highly conserved in DNA of several mammalian species including man, in three other widely divergent vertebrate phyla, and in C. elegans. “The Int region, containing 5.6 Kb 5’ and 12.8 Kb 3' to the MMTV integration site in D2, ‘was cloned in EMBL-3 from a BALB/c genomic DNA library.

The insertion mutation of int-1 and Int-2 by MMTV provirus does not appear to be stage specific (Morris et al,, 1990), This muta- tion is observed at the earliest identifiable stages of adenocarcinoma development as well as during the progression to later stages of tumors (Mortis et al, 1990).

"1216, Thrombin Modulates Phosphoinositide Metabolism, Cytosolic Calcium, and Impulse Initiation in the Heart Susan F. Steinberg, Richard B, Robinson, Howard B, Lieberm: David M. Stern, and Michael R. Rosen ‘Thrombin stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis and increases cytosolic types of cells. To determine whether thrombin exerts similar stimulatory a and whether this mechanism is linked to changes in cardiac electrical activity, the effects of thrombin on several biochemical and electrophysiological parameters were examined. In neonatal rat ventricular myocyte cultures freed of fibroblast contamination by irradiation, thrombin rapidly induced the breakdown of phosphoinositides. Formation of inositol trisphos- phate was detectable within 5 seconds and was followed by the sequential accumulation of inositol bisphosphate and inositol monophosphate. The effect of thrombin to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis was inhibited by hirudin, but not by propranolol, prazosin, or pretreatment with pertussis toxin. The inositol phospholipid response was unassociated with changes in intracellular cAMP levels. To determine the electrophysiological effects of thrombin, ‘we used microelectrode techniques to study canine Purkinje fibers. Thrombin increased the beating rate of fibers depolarized using barium, but not those at normal maximal diastolic potential, In addition, thrombin prolonged the action potential duration in fibers driven at a constant cycle length, This response was inhibited by hirudin and nisoldipine, but not by propranolol, prazosin, or pretreatment with pertussis toxin. Thrombin also augmented cesium-induced early afterdepolarizations. Using the fluorescent calcium indicator fura-2, we demonstrated that thrombin increased the beating rate, diastolic calcium, and peak systolic calcium of spontaneously contracting cultured ventricular myocytes. Cytosolic calcium also increased in both rat ventricular myocytes and canine Purkinje myocytes that were electrically driven at a constant basic cycle length, indicating that thrombin modulates cellular calcium independent ofits actions fo enhance automaticity. Taken together, these ndings trate several novel biological actions of thrombin in the mammalian heart that may functionally related. The actions of thrombin to enhance automaticity and prolong revolute tion may contribute to the clectrical abnormalities observed in the setting of myocardial ischemia and infarction, (Circulation Research 1991;68:1216-1229) pathway, is an important regulator of a vari- ety of cellular events.

Al- though the precise intracellular signaling system un- derlying the mitogenic response to thrombin is, unknown, one of the earliest events detected in thrombin-stimulated fibroblasts is the activation of a phospholipase C that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 45-bisphosphate to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP,) and diacylelycerol.** These two products act as in- tracellular second messengers.

High per- formance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of brain tissue {rom which the pineal, hypothalamus, and pituitary had been emoved confirmed recently the natural occurrence ot ‘Tyr-MIF-1 (unpublished observations). In_addtion, the presence of saturable, specifi, high afinty binding sites for ‘Tyr MIP-I has been demonstrated in rat brain; MIF-1 does not effectively compete for these sites [23] Ina test of pas- sive avoidance, administration of Tyr-MIF-1 resulted in sig niffeant changes not seen with MIF-1 at the dose tested (8), whereas significant changes in reserpine-induced hypothermia in mice were seen with MIF-1 but not ‘Tyt- MIF-1 (9). Although braia enzymes can degrade Tye-MIF-1 into MIF-1 [18}, unpublished observations indicate that the elects of injected Tyr-MIF-1 are not mediated by conver- sion in blood to MIF-1. Together these results demonstrate thatthe ozcurence of Tyr-MIT-1 cannot be accounted for bY MIF-I and raise the possiblity that atleast some of the 2c- tions of MIF-1 might not be shared by Tyr-MIF-1. ‘One of the actions MIF-1 can exert is that of an opiate antagonist. MIF-1 has been found to block the aatineciep: tive effect of opiates after acute (1, 6, 7,12, 13} orehronie 3) administration. ‘These actions did'not Seem to be mediated by mu or delta opiate receptors (13,16).

Diluent (0.9% NaCl acidified to 0.01 M with acetic acid) and, occasionally, naloxone (generously pro- vided by Endo Labs) were used for comparison with MIF-I. Experiment 1 Male, albino ICR mice weighing between 17-20 g at the time of the experiment were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Each mouse was tested ina 2.5x3 em Plexiglas tube with 2 em (I em from tip) of exposed tail covering small opening through which heat emanated from a nichromte thermal wire. A digital electronic timer was activated manually. Removal of the tail (tail-flick) from the grooved tray closed a photoelectric circuit and de- activated the timer. A rheostat maintained the heat so that the basal latency was about 4.5 sec. Each trial automatically fended at 17 sec. ‘Ten min before injection of morphine, each mouse re- ceived an intraperitoneal (TP) injection (10 ml/kg) of a freshly prepared, coded solution of MIF-L, Tyr-MIF-1, or diluent ‘Twenty mice were used at each IP dose of 0 (diluent), 0.001, 0.01, 0.4, 1.0, and 10.0 mg/kg; no mouse was used for more than oe dose of any solution.

The effects of surgical preparation and of experimental ischemia/teperfusion 00 Branulocyte function have been examined prospectively ina baboon model. Twenty-six adolescent male baboons ‘underwent surgical preparation, of which 21 underwent middle cerebral artery occlusionireperfusion. Four addi- al animals served a8 nonsurgical controls. Peripheral venous blood specimens were taken for performing as- says of leukocyte function at defined intervals before and after both the surgical preparation (i.e., the overall pro- cedure for implantation of the middle cerebral artery oc- clusion device) and occlusion/reperfusion. A stress- ‘elated elevation in total eukocyte number was attributed mainly fo an increase in the number of circulating PMN Teukoeytes.

In the nonhuman primate model, the revers- ible alterations (i.e., chemotaxis) in granulocyte function that were noted following surgical preparation resolved within 7 days.

Biochemistry Program, and Developmental Biology Sec- tion, Department of Biology, The University of Alabama, University, AL 35486, USA. (Reteived on 31 December 1981; aocepted on 5 March 1982) Abstract AA significant change in hepatic aldehyde dehydrogenase ac- tivity as been observed in normal Sprague-Dawley rat liver daring the promotion phase of hepatocarcinogenesis induced by brief feeding of 2acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) followed by tumor promotion using dietary phenobarbital (PB) ex- posure. Animals receiving only 2-AAF or PB do not possess this new aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. The phenotype is characterized by the appearance of a new cytosolic isozyme Kinetcally, electrophoretically and _immumochemically distinct from the normal liver aldehyde dehydrogenase iso- zymes and from aldchyde dehydrogenases inducible in 2-AAP-induced hepatomas. The new isozyme is NAD-depen- ‘ent, dislfiram-senstive and cross-reacts with antiserum to a normal liver aldehyde dehydrogenase inducible in several lines of rats by PB. However, the population of animals used inthis study has been shown previously to be non-responsive to aldehyde dehydrogenase induction by dietary PB. Since no animals receiving only PB express this new isozyme, the ar- cinogen must play a significant role in its induction. More- ‘over, that not all animals receiving carcinogen and promoter possess the phenotype suggests this carcinogea/promoterin- {eraction has a genetic basis, Introduction Work in our laboratory is directed toward elucidating the ‘mechanisms underlying the expression of a unique aldehyde dehydrogenase phenotype (aldehyde:NAD(P) oxidoreduc- tase, E.C, 1.2.1.3 and 13.1.) in hepatomas induced in ‘Sprague-Dawley rats by 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF)* (1~5). The phenotype is characterized by an increase in total aldehyde dehydrogenase activity due to the appearance of several cytosolic isozymes not present in normal live. The tumor isozymes are very active with aromatic aldehyde substrates and NADP as coenzyme and have electrophoretic obits, isocletrie points and immunochemical properties, distinct from those of normal liver aldehyde dehydrogenases, (2-5). The tumor phenotype is not due to reexpression of fetal aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (4). To date, we have observed no significant changes in aldehyde dehydrogenase activity in normal liver during 2-AAF-induced hepatocarcino- genesis prior to the appearance of the tumor aldehyde de- hydrogenase phenotype. In normal rat liver, aldehyde dehydrogenase exists as at ""author to whom al coespondence shouldbe adress *Avbreiaons: 2AAF, 2aceylaninaforene; PB, TCDD, 2,3, 6etrachorodbenzo down © IRL.

These isozymes can be differentiated on the basis of substrate and coenzyme preference, substrate Kn, immunochemical properties and sensitivity to inhibitors. In addition to these basal isozymes, several aldehyde de- hydrogenases can be induced by various xenobiotics in nor- ‘mal liver (@~14). Among these are two very effective pro- rmoters of hepatocarcinogenesis, phenobarbital (PB) and 2,3,7,Stetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCCD). PB induoes a ‘gtosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase in certain genetically defined lines and certain strains of rats (8—10,13). A second, cytosolic isozyme is inducible by TCDD jin both PB- responsive and non-responsive lines (11 — 13). Although the tumor aldehyde dehydrogenase isozymes differ in a number of properties from the TCDD- inducible isozyme, the TCDD- inducible isozyme is immunochemically identical to at last fone of the tumor isozymes (15). Neither the tumor nor TCDD-inducible isozymes are related to the PB-inducible isozyme (1,15). Maximal induction of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity o°- curs within 3 days of PB exposure and within 14 days follow- ing TCDD exposure (8,11). In as much as some of the hepatomas possessing the tumor aldehyde dehydrogenases hhave been induced by a turor-induction protocol employing PB as a promoter and at least one tumor isozyme and the ‘TCDD-induetble isozyme are immunochemicaly identical, it ‘was of interest to determine when the tumor aldehyde de- hydrogenase phenotype is first detectable during the tumor- {induction process. The results of such an experiment indicate that the tumor aldehyde dehydrogenase phenotype is indeed tumor-specific (6). It is not detectable in any grossly normal liver during or following carcinogen exposure, even in animals receiving PB as promoter. In the course of this work, however, we did observe a significant change in the hepatic aldehyde dehydrogenase phenotype of some individuals that received 2-AAF followed by PB. The characterization and significance of this change are reported here.

"“SUBJECT: WINSTON Drag Racing - Opportunities Recently, I had an opportunity to view a drag racing event in Rockingham. The concentration and impact of our overall identifi-~ cation and the young adult male orientation of this growing sport are factors which make this a unique activity. As we move toward our planning for next year, the following observa~ tions should be note: 1, Improvements are needed in two key areas relating to sampling and promotional products: (a) The unique, open accessibility and spectator traffic flow make sampling more difficult, (b) The strong orientation of this group to t-shirts and the active merchandising by the various racing sponsor/concessionaires places our Promotional Products Group approach at a competitive disadvantage. Recommendation/Action Program Discussions with R. Powell and J. Byrd have generated a variety of ideas for testing to address current needs. The focal point of the test effort would be a tent and activity area which would serve as a sampling distribution point, a display area estab- lishing brand sponsorship to smokers, and a opportunity for broader, more aggressive merchandising of our Promotional Pro- ducts Group items. In effect, a grouping of current low level activities into a more concentrated area, positioned to maximize traffic flow, would heighten our brand presence -at the event. (This is not too unlike the VANTAGE PGA tent which is designed for a similar sampling objective.) Proposed testing of this activity area, accompanied by other Proven volune oriented and consumer involvement activities, will help provide a much needed promotional focus to drag racing. It [, is proposed that the test of this program would be scheduled for hye Labor Day weekend at Indianapolis. Funding would be provided by Promotion/Promotional Products Group test dollars with ultimate funding for this effort from Sampling and Promotional Products eeu’ Group budgets. we 2£92 éL90s",0

These data strongly support the “accessibility” model for the regulation of isotype switching and suggest tht lymphokines suchas Hl-4 may direct specific switch events by transcriptional vetivation of the corresponding switch regions, <ell<lerived lymphokines play an important role in the regulation of immunoglobulin isotype switching. Interleukin 4 (IL-4) induces the expression of IgG (1) and IgE. (2) and suppresses the expression of IgM. IsG3, and lgG2 in mito- gen-activated B cells (3). IL-4 prepares resting, surface IgG-negative B cells to secrete IgG1 in response to subse ‘quent stimulation with bacterial ipopolysaccharide (LPS) (4) and enhances the precursor frequency of IgG1-seereting cells (5.5). Ihe IL-4mediated switch accompanied by increased transeription of 1 heavy-chain constant-region (Cy) genes (7) and increased steady-state levels of pl MRNA (). Heavy-chain class switching in terminally differentiated B cells is characterized by DNA rearrangement that juxtae poses the assembled variable-region gene from the 4/6 {transcription unit to a downstream Cy gene with deletion of the intervening Cy, genes (9.10). Studies of hybridomas (11, and normal murine R cells (13) indicate that switeh recombination is directed to the same switch region (S} on both the productive and the nonproductive Cy alleles. sue: gesting that itis @ directed, rather than stochastic, process {Q0).

"Platelet Thrombospondin Forms a Trimolecular Complex with Plasminogen and Histidine-rich Glycoprotein Roy L. Silverstein, Lawrence L. K. Leung, Peter C. Harpel, and Ralph L. Nachman Department of Medicine, Division of Hematlogy-Oncology, and the Specialized Center of Research in Thrombosis, The New York HosplCornell Medical Center, New York 10021 Abstract Torombospondin (TSP), a multifunctional a-granule glycopro- tein of human platelets binds fibrinogen, fibronectin, heparin, histidine-rich glycoprotein (HIRGP), and plasminogen (Pig), and thus, may play an important role in regulating thrombotic Influences a vessel surfaces. In this study we have demonstrated that purified human platclt TSP formed atrimolecular complex with human Pig and HRGP. Complex formation was detected by a specific binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) which demonstrated simultaneous binding of fuid- phase Plg and HRGP to TSP adsorbed to microttration wells. While neither ligand inhibited complex formation of the other with TSP, 10 mM eamino-r-caproie acid selectively blocked incorporation of Pig into the complex, suggesting that TSP contains independent binding sites for Plg and HIRGP. Com parable extent of trimolecular complex formation was also detected when TSP monomer was substituted for whole TSP inthe ELISA. HIRGP covalently crosslinked to Sepharose 4B simultaneously bound both ""S-TSP and ""1-Pig, confieming teimolecular complex formation, Rocket immunoelectrophoresis ‘of mixtures of the purified radiolabeled proteins into anti-Pig containing agarose also confirmed trimolecular complex for- tation, The TSP-HRGP-Pig complex hound 2 similar amount of heparin as the TSP-HRGP complex, demonstrating that the HIRGP within the trimolecular complex maintained functional capability. Similarly, using a Muorometsie plasmin substrate, the trimoleclar complex was shown tobe an effective substrate for tissue plasminogen activator. Significant amounts of plasmin were generated from the TSP-HRGP-Pig complex (cquivalent to that from the TSP-Plg complex), but the rate of plasmin aeneration from the trimolecular complex was greater than from the bimolecular complex, suegesting an important inter- action of HRGP with Plg when both are complexed to TSP. ‘The macromolecular assembly of these three proteins on celular surfaces, such a5 the platelet, may serve important regulatory functions, both prothrombotic at sites of active fibrin deposition and proteolytic ln noafibriaontaning miero- ‘environments.

June 1988, 2065-2073 ‘Thrombospondin-Plewninggen-Hisidinesrich Glycoprotein Complex Formation (G, 4) and becomes surface associated upon platelet stimulation G). It is also a product of endothelial cells (6, 7), fibroblasts (@), and monocytes (9), and isa constituent ofthe extracellular ‘matrix (8). TSP is @ multifunctional molecule that appears to be organized, like fibronectin (10), into diserete functional domains (11-13), The endogenous lectin of human platelets is TSP (14, 15) and anti-TSP Fab partially inhibits platelet aggregation (16), suggesting an important role in platelet function. Among other known functions of TSP are the ability to bind specifically with heparin (1, 11), fibrinogen (17), fibronectin (17, 18), and type V collagen (19), and thus, perhaps play a role in extracellular matrix organization, cell- cell and cali:matsix communication, and modulation of he- mostasis. Recently we have shown that there is a high affinity interaction of TSP with histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRGP) (20) and with plasminogen (Pig) (21). HRGP, an a2-elycopro- {ein of human plasma (22), i also found in platelet a-granles and is seereted upon platelet activation (23). It isa protein of ‘multiple functions, including metal binding and perhaps trans- port (24), immunoregulation (25), and modulation of hemo- stasis, HRGP binds heparin sith bigh affinity and neutralizes its anticoagulant effect (26, 27); it also binds Plg via that protein's high affinity Wysine-binding site (LBS) (28) and thus may serve as a physiological counterpart tothe antifibrinlytic amino acids. The TSP-HRGP complex retains the heparin binding and neutralizing function of HRGP (20), and the ‘TSP-Plg interaction, which is also mediated via the Plg LBS, interferes with the ability of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) to activate Plg (21) on a fibrin clot. In this paper, we report that TSP can form a trimolecular complex with HRGP. ‘and Pig and thatthe HGP and Pig within the macromolecular ‘complex retain functional capability. Such functional macro- ‘molecular complexes, when assembled on platelet as well as ‘other cellular surfaces, may modulate thrombotic as well as fibrinolytic events. Methods. ‘Materials.

"February 20, 1996 Ofce of he Director Dr, Carl Ehmann RJ Reynolds P.O. Box 2959 15 Reynolds Winston-Salem, N.C. 27102 Dear Dr. Ehmann; Lang cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for men aitd women in the U.S., and more people die annually of lung cancer than of colon cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer combined. Screening for lung cancer, even if targeted at high risk individuals, has so far been ineffectual, and treatment advances are modest at best. Asa result, inthe lst 20 years the 5-year lung cancer survival rate of 13% has not changed appreciably. lung cancer, are the result Factors and the biologic of an accumulation of genetic mutations caused by éavironmid process of aging, Cancer develops if the balance between the accumulation of new mutations and thi rep by enzymes feiponsbls fr DNA ilepy and Belt is disturbed, Each individual's susceptibility to cancer results from his/her inherited ability to maintain this balance. For example, some people do'ioi develop ung cancer even if they smoke more than 3 packs of cigarettes per day while others will do so even if they had ‘only minimal tobacco exposure. Identifying the genes responsible for this genetic susceptibility will be of paramount importance for future advances in lung cancer. Knowing the identity of these genes could lead to the targeting of risk factor intervention programs, early detection programs, and chemoprevention trials to those individuals at tisk for developing lung cancer rather than the population at large. Knowing the function ‘of these genes could lead to the rational design of agents (for instance drugs) which can modify or supplement genetic deficiencies. These would be major advances which could result in completely new approaches to chemoprevention and treatment. ‘Theres little doubt that most cancers, and in particular ‘During the last 3 1/2 years Dr. Gerold Bepler has successfully identified and characterized two regions on the short arm of chromosome 11 which must contain genes ‘important in lung cancer development and progression.

Arginine-175,4-Which makes critical contacts in the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket, was mutated to lysine or alanine. Unexpectedly, both mutations created v-s7¢ alleles that transform chicken cells with wild-type (wt) efficiency and are reduced for transformation of rat cells; these alleles are host dependent for transformation. Addition- ally, these alleles resulted in a round morphological transformation of chicken cells, Unlike 12 of the 13 known hostdependent fre SED mutations that result in a fusiform morphology. Analysis of phosphopeptide binding by the mutant SH2 domains reveal that the in vitro ability to bind phosp! peptides known to have a high afnty for wt are SH2 correlates with wt (round) morphological transformation in chicken cells and the in vitro ability to bind phosphopeptides known to have a low alfnty for wt sre SH2 correlates with rat cell transformation.

Despite inten- (©1997 by The American Society for Cell Biology 50735052 sive efforts, a complete understanding of the biochem- {cal mechanism of transformation by pp60°* is still lacking.

One class of such sits. the E box elements, has Deen particularly well studiod and shares @ consensus sequence of GCAGXTG (Church etl, 1985; Ephrussi al, 1985). The proteins that bind to the E box elements have recently boon identified and belong to a family of DNA-binding proteins, designated as helictoop-helo (HLH) proteins (Mure etal, 1994). These proteins share arogion ‘of homology in the basic helix-loop-helix domain anc theit DNA-binding and dimerization domains (Mure et a 1989a, 1994), Severalofthe class HLH proteins have been implicated In the regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression. In re-B, mature B, and plasma cells, tissue-specific com plexes are present that bind to the wE2, wES, ues, xE, ‘and xE2 sites present in the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain gene enhancers (Bain etal, 1993: Jacobs » 1993; Murre et al. 1991). At the pre-B cel stage, it is ‘redominantly E2-2, andtoa lesser degroe E2A, that binds {o the E box sites (Bain etal, 1993). However, during the pre-B to mature B coll ansiton, E2-2 protein levels drop ‘and E2A levels increase. At the mature B col stage iis predominantly E2A that binds tothe E box sites (Bain et al, 1993). Further evidence that E2A products might be involved in regulating Immunoglobulin gene expression ‘comes from studies in which overexpression of E47 in re-T calls leads to induction of garmin immunoglobulin. hheavy chain gone expression, immunoglobulin OJ re- arrangement, and increased levels of Oct-2 and RAG gene ‘expression (Schiissol otal, 19918).

We feel that appropriate methodology is one of our primary goals. I would appreciate an opportunity to discuss with you procedures so that we need not explore any blind alleys already discovered by you. Similarly, it would seem to me that, should we be fortunate enough to uncover any useful information, we would like very much to share it with you. On page 12 you discuss Epidemiological Studies. We are interested in pulling out of the gross population data that part of it that pertains to cigar smokers and cigar smoking. We've given some support to Dawber at BUMC. I explored the issues with the Tecumseh people, and have made initial overtures towards the group that is pooling data.

"ANTICANCER RESEARCH 14: 2457-2464 (1994) Establishment of a Human Melanoma Cell Line Lacking p53 Expression and Spontaneously Metastasizing in Nude Mice* SIKHA RAUTH'* JULIA KICHINA', ALBERT GREEN’, LAURA BRATESCU! and TAPAS K, DAS GUPTA! ""Department of Surgical Oncology and 7 of Genetics, University of Ilinois at Chicago, 840 South Wood Street (MIC 820), Chicago, Ilinois 60612, U.S.A. Abstract. Nine human melanoma cell lines established in our laboratory were analyzed for p53 gene expression and their ‘tumorigenic and metastatic potential in nude mice. Northern blot analyses showed that ive ofthe cell lines (55%) had ether ‘complete loss or low levels of p53 transcripts. Immmunocytoche- ‘mical analysis for p53 protein expression agreed with mRNA analysis results, Nucleotide sequencing showed no mutations inexons 5 through 8 of the gene. All cell ines except one gave rise 10 tumors at subcutaneous inoculation sites in nude mice. The melanoma cell line UISO-MEL-6, completely lacking p53 expression, spontaneously metastasized to tung and liver in nude mice. Homan melanoma develops in a sequence of steps: from benign proliferative lesions of normal melanocytes, to prim- ary melanomas, to locally invasive melanomas and metastasis, (1). Conventional surgical procedures are curative in most Patients with early localized primary melanoma; however, the prognosis is grave once the disease metastasizes (2-4). In the past few years, efforts have been made to identify major ‘events that lead to the development of melanoma and its Progression to metastasis. Stil, the genes and molecules which might play an important role in melanoma genesis are not identified. Several studies detected ras gene activation in. human melanoma (5-7). Expression of epidermal growth facior receptor gene has been implicated in melanoma metastases (6,9). Recent studies indicate that tumor suppressor p33 may play an important role inthe development and progression of “Supported by a grant from the American Cancer Socie s Division, and the Mr. Soper Research on Induction and Cure of Human Neoplasia Fund. * Correspondence to: Dr. 8. Rath Key Words: Homan melanoma, p53 expression, tumorigenicity metastasis, (0250-70057%4 $2.00.40 ‘melanoma (10-12). P53 alteratioys were frequently detected in cutaneous and choroidal melanoma (11,12). This gene appears to be central tothe development of human malignan- ies, because, in different tumor types, both alleles ae often ‘mutated (13). Human malignant cels lacking normal p33 ‘expression, when transfected with wildtype pS3, grew at a slower rate in culture (14-17) and had reduced tumorigenicity in nude mice (18). Although many studies suggest that p53 alteration in melanoma is probably more frequent than is generally recognized, the exact incidence and mechanism of its influence on initiation, growth, and progression of human ‘melanoma need to be further investigated In the studies reported here, we analyzed nine metastatic ‘melanoma cell lines for pS3 expression at the RNA. and protein levels, by both molecular and immunocytochemical approaches, We also searched these cel lnes for mutations in ‘exons 5 through 8 of the p53 gene, where mutations most frequently occur in other malignancies. We then investigated ‘whether different levels of p53 gene expression are correlated with tumor growth potential and metastatic behavior of the ‘melanoma cet lines in vivo. In our study, the melanoma cel line completely lacking p53 expression metastasized spon- taneously in nude mice. ‘Materials and Methods Cal tines n these studies, we wsed human melanoma cll ines which ere derived from metasati tumor specimens (UISO MEL2, 3,46, 7, ll, 16, and 23), foreskin meanootc eel Hine, and moval line (WSI)estabised in our aberatory (19).

Kobal Dose-dependent stereoselective activation of the trigeminal sensory system by nicotine in man Received: 16 March 1998/Final version: 14 September 1998 Abstract Rationale: Nicotine applied to the nasal cav- ity can evoke ‘odorous’ sensations in the concentration range near the detection threshold by the activation of the olfactory sensory system and at higher concentra- tions ‘burning’ and ‘stinging’ sensations by the dose- dependent recruitment of C- and Aé-fibers of the trigeminal sensory system. Neuronal nicotinic acetyl- choline receptor (nAchR) subunits are expressed in trigeminal primary afferents and could constitute the receptors involved in nicotine perception. Objective: In the present study, we dose-dependently investigated the stereoselective effects of RCH)- and S(— the trigeminal and olfactory sensory system in man. ‘Methods: Trigeminal detection thresholds forthe ‘burn ing’ and “stinging” sensations and the olfactory detec- tion threshold for the ‘odorous’ sensation were determined. In order to quantify trigeminal activation, wwe recorded summated electrical responses from the respiratory nasal mucosa during stimulation with R(+)- ‘and S(—)-nicotine vapor (40, 80, 120, 160 ng/ml; stim: ulus duration: 250 ms), In addition, subjects rated the intensity of ‘odorous’, “burning” and ‘stinging’ sensa- tions. For chemical stimulation with nicotine enan- tiomers, a vapor-cilution olfactometer (constant flow rate: 140 ml/s, humidity: 80%, temperature: 37°C, stimulus duration 250 ms) was employed, Results: We found significant stereoselective differences for the trigeminal but not for the olfactory system, i.e. higher summated responses, higher trigeminal intensity esti- mates, and lower trigeminal detection thresholds for N.

Conclusion: Our resulls clearly demonstrate the diferent stereoselective activation of the trigeminal sensory system by R(+)- and S(—)-nicotine, indicating the presence of specific stereoselective receptors on trigeminal nociceptive ‘A6- and C-fibers. Key words Nicotine  Stereoisomers - Sensory ‘Trigeminal - Olfaction - Pain Introduction Stercospecific binding of nicotine enantiomers has been demonstrated for high and low affinity binding sites in the central nervous system, and in the periphery for binding sites at the nicotinic receptor of the autonomic and the somatic nervous systems (Melzer et al, 1980; Romano and Goldstein 1980; Martin and Accto 1981; Tkushima et al. 1982; Abood et al. 1985; Sloan ct al 1985; Accto et al. 1986; Henley and Oswald 1987; Goldberg et al. 1989). The quantitative differences in binding values (ICs) of nicotine enantiomers seem to be small compared to the differences observed for the stereoisomers of opioids. Abood et al. (1985) found a threefold greater ICsy value for R(+)-nicotine than for ‘S(~-nicotine at the higher affinity site and twioe that atthe lower affinity site. The affinity of opioids to the ul-receptor was 10-fold higher for RC) than for ‘S(--}rmethadone (Kristensen et al. 1995), It has been shown in Dreiding models that the nitrogen atoms of the nicotine stereoisomers are nearly superimposable (Aceto et al. 1986), thus explaining the small stereo- Selective diferences using the simplicity of the nicotine molecule. Nicotine itself resembles. the structural properties of acetylcholine. The pyridine nitrogen of Bicotine is an electron donor similar to the keto ‘oxygen of the acetyl group of acetylcholine; the posi- tive charge of the pyrrolidine nitrogen of nicotine is 2505324601",6

Yuile et al. (0) found pri- ary lung ,tumors (mostly epidermoid Carcinomas) in 3 to 13 percent of rats ‘which received 71 to 538 rads from ""Po jnhaled ina sodium chloride aerosol.

"Mp Interoffice Memorandum ‘Phacco Company Subject: Market Share Study Date: November 8, 1991 To: Ms. R. H. Steele From: Tory Payne Objective: To investigate the relationship between mutagenicity and weight of tobacco burned, tar, cigarette length, and air dilution for RJR products. Summary: Mutagenicity estimates using a nonlinear regression model were obtained on a sample of 24 RJR products, Correlations between mutagenicity (estimated from linear and nonlinear regression models) and weight of tobacco burned, tar, cigarette length and air dilution were determined. Preliminary regression analyses were performed to investigate the relationship of the above-mentioned variables to mutagenicity. Conclusions: Tar and air dilution were the best single predictors of mutagenicity on a revertants/mg tar basis. Tar was the best single predictor for mutagenicity on a revertants/cigarette basis, followed by weight of tobacco burned. Various combinations of weight, length, tar and air dilution predicted mutagenicity better than any variable by itself. However, variables other than these influence mutagenicity since the percent of variability explained ranged from only 48% to 82%. 8 3 2",0
"RIR Inter-office Memorandum Subject: Administrative Costs of Air Quality Control #*! December 12, 1974 Program To: James S. Dowdell From: y, E, Miller, Jr. As we agreed at our meeting with Messrs. Sherrill, Speer and McGrane on December 9, I am forwarding to you our past and current costs of administering RJRT's Air Quality Control Program. 1. Cost of Initial Source Registration State and County Air Quality Regulations require that all sources of emissions to atmosphere be identified and registered. This involved testing gaoh of the Company's stacks or emission points (approximately 600) and submitting data on the related process as well as the emissions. This emission inventory and registration will be com- pleted around the first of the year, at a total cost of approximately $300,000. The Forsyth County Environmental Affairs Department has requested additional information which they say is necessary to complete their files to satisfy E.P.A. require- ments. It would cost approximately $25,000 to compile this additional information which includes complete and detailed flow diagrams of every Company process. We feel that the previously submitted data is sufficient for the Agency's purposes, and that anything further will be a waste of time and money as well as release of much proprietary type information. 2. Annual Monitoring and Administrative Costs For the last several years, RJRT has averaged spending $200,000 per year for air quality monitor- ing, data handling, program administration and preliminary studies. This does not include any costs directly related to individual air quality projects such as design and project management, or any of the capital expenditures on the projects. I anticipate that we will continue spending between $150,000 and $200,000 per year on air quality monitoring and administration. A great deal of this effort will be necessary to provide information to the County for permits required for each process or source.addition or modification.

Frank Perkins 2 Vice President and Technical Director Flavor Division Firmenich Incorporated wo P.O. Box 5880 Princeton, NJ 08540 - : Dear Dr. Perkins: . You may already be aware that the US Department of Health and Human Services has requested information from tobacco manu- facturers relating to the ingredients commonly added to commer- cially manufactured cigarettes. This request was made as first step by HHS in compliance with Section 403 of Public Law 95-626 which requires that the Secretary of this Department ""shall conduct, or arrange the conduct of, a study or studies of, (1) the relative health -risks associated with smoking cigarettes of varying levels of tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide; and (2) the health risks associated with smoking cigarettes containing any substances commonly added to commercially manufactured ciga- rettes."" Various tobacco companies have responded to these xequests giving general information and information not con- sidered to be proprietary in nature. HHS has responded to these submissions asking for more detail. Therefore, as an addendum to the confidentiality agreement “between Lorillard and Firmenich, dated June 1979, I am requesting f from Firmenich a letter authorizing Lorillard to disclose the contents of flavor ingredient lists supplied by Firmenich as part of a composite scrambled list of all flavor ingredients used by Lorillard if a government agency formally demands such disclo- sure. In the event that Lorillard is required by the government to disclose the flavor ingredients used, we intend to supply an alphabetical listing of all ingredients thus making it impossible to determine the composition of any single compounded flavor represented therein. Furthermore, unless specifically required to do so, we do not intend to identify the sources of these ingredients. Therefore, the supplier's proprietary interests will be even more strictly preserved. ZOzezeto",0

"“We Card"" Program Announced to Help Prevent Tobacco Sales to Minors For the first time ever, the nation's largest retailer and wholesaler organizations have joined forces to address head-on the issue of youth smoking. The group, representing more than 150,000 retailers nationwide, will work together through the Coalition for Responsible Tobacco Retailing with support from Philip Morris and the rest of the tobacco industry. “This is the result of an extraordinary effort from many organizations,"" said Teri Richman, spokeswoman for the coalition. ""The Coalition for Responsible Tobacco Retailing represents a cooperative and dedicated national effort among retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers who all share one common goal -- to do everything we can to prevent tobacco sales to minors."" At a recent news conference, the coalition announced a major new program, called “We Card,"" that will provide training and educational materials to retailers to help prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors. The “We Card"" program marks the first unified effort ever by the tobacco industry to address the youth smoking issue. The “We Card"" program uses tested ideas to build on previous efforts. It offers heightened awareness and thorough employee training to improve compliance with laws that prohibit the sale of tobacco products to minors. FSOS9TE HO",9

If 0, how? Tf not, we should encourage her to, staxting out with the fact that she is 4 non-smoker, not a menber of any snokers' rights croup (assuming she isn’t) and has no relative employed by a tobacco company. Then we should provide her with a very reasoned attack on the science (since that is what Kilts says he is interested in debating; both EPA risk assessment and Fonthan study justifying OSHA 1AQ zegulation) and a pointed xeprimand for degrading CRS. I wonder if Hilts' knows that it was Henry Waxman (and Wendell Ford) who requested the study? I've alzeady spoken wich Matt Repp and put a plan in motion to get Hilts’ letter to the CRS authors. We have a very good case to make on the science, especially now that we have the abortion and EMF issues on the front pages, and Marthe is a great ambassador. Your thoughts?",2

However, islet metabolic fune tion is irreversibly inhibited afer a 36-h incubetion with IL-1P, asa addtional 8h incubatien with NMMA or aminoguanidine does not Stimulate the recovery ofinsulin secretion, aonitase activity, oF pro- tein synthesis, The irveversible inhibition of metabolic function sor. relates with the commitment of islets to destruction.

Now messenger RNA expression appears tobe required for islet recovery from IL-1f-induced damage as actinomyein D pre vents the recovery of islet aconitase seliviy. Lastly, treatment of hhuman islets with a combination of I-18 and interferon-y (IFN) results in a potent inhibition of mitochondrial aconitase setivity NMMA, when cocultured with IL-1p + TPNy, completely prevents ‘ytokine-induced inhibition of human islet aonitase activity NMA, when udded to human islets pretreated for 18 with IL-p + IFNy, stimulates the recovery of mitochondrial aonitase activity after an ‘additional 8 h incubation, These findings indicate that nitric oxide- induced islet damage is reversible; however, prolonged production of nitric oxide after a 86-h exposure ta IL-1) result in the irreversible Inhibition of islet metabolic and secretory function.

Cytokines, released during insulitis, have ‘been proposed to participate in B-cell destruction during the <development of autoimmune diabetes (1,2) Previous reports have shown that islets incubated with the cytokine interleu- kkin-1f (IL-1) express the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and produce high levels ofnitric oxide (3-7). The cell appears to be the islet cellular source of INOS in response to IL-1 (6, 7). The increased production of nitric oxide by IL-1 treated islets correlates with a potent inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion that is prevented by NOS inhibitors, aminoguanidine (AG), and N°-mono- methyl-t-arginine (NMMA; Refs. 3-7). Nitric oxide, which targets iron-sulfur centers, inhibits the electron transport chain at complexes 1 and Il and the Krebs cycle enzyme, aconitase (8,9) IL-1 has been shown to inhibit islet aconitase activity and the oxidation of glucose to CO,, resulting in a reduced cellular level of ATP (6, 10, 11).

Although IL-1 stimulates islet and f-cell damage. the de- structive effects of this cytokine on islet metabolic function are reversible. Ratislets incubated with IL-1 for 1Sh require a 4-day incubation in cytokine free media to restore normal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (12, 13) This window of functional recovery can be reduced to 8 h by the inhibition ‘of iNOS (14), The addition of NMMA to islets preincubated for 18 h with IL-1, followed by an S-h incubation in the presence of both NMMA and IL-1, results in a complete recovery of insulin secretion (14). Recovery of insulin secre- tion function is paralleled by a simultaneous recovery of ‘mitochondrial aconitase activity (14). The aim ofthis study was to identify the length of exposure of islets to IL-1 that leads to irreversible inhibition of insulin secretion and to determine whether the irreversible inhibition of insulin se- ‘cretion correlates with an irreversible inhibition of islet met- abolic function.

"STATISTICS IN MEDICINE, VOL. 14, 548-569 (1995) META-ANALYTIC APPROACHES TO DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIPS, WITH APPLICATION IN STUDIES OF LUNG CANCER AND EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE R. L, TWEEDIE AND K. L. MENGERSEN Department of Staite, Colorado State Univers. Fert Collins, CO 80523, USA SUMMARY “This paper outlines several meta-analytic approaches to the assessment of quantal dose-response {elationships. that is, to the evaluation ofan increase inthe level of exposure to an agent and the associated felative risk ofa disease when this is investigated over a numberof diferent studies. Analysis is developed at two levels: first, @ consistent method of evaluating the dose-response relationship is applied to each study. and seeond, an overall picture is obtained by comparing and combining these relationships. At the fist ‘tage for an individual study, dose-response assessment involves choices of model and appropriate tests for trend, which are influenced by such issues as dose measurement and use of the unexposed group. At the second stage different methods for pooling results across studies must be considered. These depend on the choices made in the fist stage of analysis, with additional atention paid to heterogeneity, and possible bias Sue to studies included in meta-analysis. We describe these meta-analytic approaches for three methods of, ‘evaluating dose response. The approaches ae illustrated by evaluating the relationship between lung cancer “ind levels of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). The strength ofthis relationship has been & point of debate in recent assessment of evidence for an overall carcinogenic efect of ETS exposure. We find lite indication of @ consistent dose response, a result explained in terms of recent models for cancer and passive smoking developed by Darby and Pike, the current meta-analysis results of overall risk-ratios of Eureent studies in Tweedie and Mengersen, and misclasification models developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 1. INTRODUCTION ‘There are two reasons for assessing dose-response relationships, or the increase in level of risk of. 4 disease associated with an increase in level of exposure to a potentially harmful agent. First, establishing such a relationship is one of several standard criteria for developing the case for the agent in question actually being harmful; if increased risk occurs with increased dose, itis a strong step in proving that a causal association exists. Second, when an association has been established between an agent and a disease, the dose-response relationship is of crucial use in predicting the levels of risk established for individuals at different levels of exposure Both of these are unarguably important. Standard guidelines (see the International’Agency for Research into Cancer (IARC) Report,’ or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Guidelines?) for asserting that there is an established causal link between an agent and a disease suggest establishing ofa significant dose-response effect as a valuable step. This isnot the only step required to establish a causal relationship, and is probably of second-order importance compared CCC 0277-4715/95/060545-25 © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Led. sug gngonu. ws Bale ena.

BYLINE: Joe Hawkins CREDIT: SPECIAL TO THE BANNER EST, PAGES: 2 : 01/05/96 NSHV22827 Nashville Banner; NSHV SECTION: News; PAGE: Al3 (Copyright 1996) column: COMMUNITY VOICES There is an issue currently facing Tennesseans and their agricultural heritage that is much more complex than would be realized at first glance. The issue is that of regulatory jurisdiction of tobacco-related products For those Tennesseans not involved in agriculture production or non-tobacce users, the issue vould seem even more insignificant than However, this is an issue of tremendous importance to Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a far-reaching plan to exercise regulatory control over the marketing and sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. The foundation for this action is based on the FDA assumption that tobacco products are a delivery device of nicotine Two major concerns arise from this regulatory initiative. While the anti-tobacco forces of today's society argue that the tobacco issue should be addressed without regard to economics, it is unrealistic to do so. Economics cannot be disregarded for it is the very purpose of the production process. Tobacco producers do not grow tebacco to create a ‘‘drug delivery system.'! Tebacco producers grow tobacco in order to pay the bills that in turn help maintain other business activity. Production has, through the years, passed on a strong work ethic, an ability to provide for a family on limited production resources, land significant economic benefit to the local, state and federal tax revenue. It has clothed, fed and educated a significant number of Tennesseans. It is interesting to note that Tennessee passed a temporary tax in 1925 on tobacco products to fund education. That tax was made permanent in 1927, and in 1994 resulted in an excess of $84 million for education. No other product can compete with that contribution, just as no other product can offer the return on investment to the Producer. If the demand for any product provided the production incentive of tobacco, producers would respond. Alternative crops are often suggested, however, if a major shift to any other production was successful without major marketing network changes for that production, chaos and bankruptcy would be the result for many. Aside from economics, another major concern arises from this FDA TI1686-0058",9

"Biology Elizabeth Pennisi reports From Sarasoa, Fla, atthe annual meeting ofthe Association for Chemoreception Sciences Foods that fool the body with low fat Nutritionists and food companies may have more success promoting healthy diets If they concentrate on reducing fat in specific foods. Unfortunately, ice cream isnt one of them. People can judge the fat content of milk-based products ‘much more easily than the fat in mixed foods, such as chicken salad, report Beverly J. Tepper and Susan E. Shaffer of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N. ‘Tepper and Shaffer tested the ability of 73 people to judge the richness of various foods. Each person visited the research lab twice weekly for two weeks. At each five versions of six common foods. The looked and tasted the same but varied in fat content and texture. Inone est, participants judged the relative fat contents of the different versions by comparing them to one another; in another test conducted ona different day, they estimated théfat content of each version separately. In neither test could participants accurately judge the fat content of scrambled eggs or chicken spread, Tepper says, but in both tests they succeeded in ranking mashed potatoes and pudding — two milk-based foods. They also distinguished the Telative richness of crunchy snacks fried in different oils. “In some foods, people are going to notice the difference {in fat content}, but'in others, you can make relatively large ‘changes without people noticing,” Tepper concludes. Alzheimer’s disease: Does the nose know? {An insidious disease, Alzheimer’s can start to develop long. before one can detect troublesome losses in cognitive function. However, people with this disease also lose some of their sense ‘of smell. Researchers hope that monitoring changes in this sense will help them detect the disease earlier and aid in tracking its progression. “The goal is to develop an early marker or something that ‘could {change} along with the disease,” explains Jack Pearl of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders in Bethesda, Md. “An olfactory test is a relatively noninvasive way of testing” ‘Toward that end, several research groups have begun studying the ability of older people, with and without Alzheim- e's, to detect and remember odors, Ina study conducted at the University of California, San Diego, Medical Center, 65 people with Alzheimer’s disease and ‘82 healthy people of similar ages and backgrounds underwent vision, taste, and odor tests. The vision and taste components. helped the scientists determine whether the participants were ‘of sound enough mind for testing and whether deterioration had occurred in more than one sensé ‘One of the odor tests required participants to sniff alcohol from pairs of plastic squeeze bottles and pick out the one with the stronger scent. By supplying bottles with different concen- trations of alcohol, the researchers could tell at what concen- tration the person first detected the odor. The same people also sipped sugar water samples with differing degrees of sweet- ness and were asked to spit out the sweeter one. Participants with Alzheimer’s needed much stronger odors than the healthy sniffers, say Claire Murphy and Steven Nordin, who led the study. “The more demented [the person], the higher the threshold, but there was no such correlation for taste,"" adds Nordin. “The research suggests there isa specific detection dysfunction to odors.” Furthermore, he notes, in the seven people with Alzheimer’s disease who have now been tested for three years, the average yearly change in the odor-detection threshold has correlated with the progression of dementi A second experiment assessed the participants’ ability to recognize odors they had smelled earlier. Each person looked 300 at 10 faces of presidents and 10 engineering symbols and ‘smelled 10 common household odors. They then examined a second set of faces, symbols, and odors, half of which came from the first set. Participants tended to score the same when rating familiar faces and symbols as when rating odors they had sniffed earlier. But Alzheimer's patients scored lower ‘overall, indicating a general decline in memory, says Nordin. At Duke University in Durham, NC., psychologist Susan S. ‘Schiffman and her colleagues track changes in healthy people ‘who are at risk of developing Alzheimer’s. So far, the study involves 22 such individuals and 22 people matched for age, ‘gender, race, level of education, and handedness who are not, ‘considered at risk or the disease, Participants undergo several tests, including ones in which they pick the stronger of two flavors or odors and are asked to remember familiar ones. ‘The twogroups differ only intheirability toremember odors, reports Brevick G. Graham of Duke. “I wouldnt suggest that [odor testing] would ever replace any ‘of the cognitive measures, but it might be used in addition to ‘other things for early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s.” he says. There's no accounting for taste Countless studies have indicated that animals avoid bitter foods. But some actually prefer acrid flavors, reports John 1. Glendinning of the University of Arizona in Tucson. While Glendinning was at Florida State University in Tal- lahassee, he studied the eating habits of two species of wild Mexican mice. He discovered that while none of the Peromyscus ‘melanotismice liked bitter flavors, seven of 64 Peromyscus azteca mice preferred quinine water over regular water. He then offered both species hop extract, tannic acid, and two other bitter ‘substances. “These chemicals are realy different, bt neverthe- less they all elicit similar responses,” Glendinning told Science. News, “individuals that prefer quinine were more likely to prefer ‘other bitter chemicals” up to a certain concentration. Glendinning calls this the “Schweppes effec,” after the tonic water that some people prefer over regular water. Citing other studies showing that some goats, opossums, and squirrel monkeys like bitter foods, he suggests that many animals ‘exhibit this effect, although he doesn't really know why. He suspects, however, that in foods — particularly plants — bitterness may reflect higher nutritional content. How sweet a protein can be ‘A reddish fruit sold in Nigerian markets has provided scientists with yet another supersweet protein. Ounce per ‘ounce, this S2-amino-acld protein, called brazzein, provides 2000 times the sweetness of sugar, reports Ding Ming, @ biochemist atthe University of Wisconsin-Madison. He and Wisconsin colleague Gran Hellekant isolated the protein from Pantadiplandra brazzeana, a vine plant that produces a fruit, slightly bigger than a grape. “The sugar [content] isnot that high; we guess thatthe sweet protein plays the same role as sugar,” says Ming. Sweetness may_ encourage animals to eat such fruits and help disperse seeds, he explains. Brazzeins lysine-rich amino acid sequence beats tittle resemblance to those of other sweet proteins (SN: 5/19/90, 315), which tend to contain many more amino acids, says Ming. This protein also proves quite stable, surviving 98°C temperatures for at least two hours. and’ maintaining. its sweetness in a wide range of acidic and alkaline solutions, the researchers report. Moreover, electrical recordings from taste ‘nerves of primates reveal thatthe protein elicits a purely sweet sensation, with no aftertaste. The Wisconsin scientists have applied for a patent for the protein, ‘SCIENCE NEWS, VOL. 143, 89EL09E902",6

"APPENDIX F Article by Mariella Bertucelli published in 11 Tirreno THE REVENGE OF NICOTINE Beneficial psychosomatic effects: an English study Reading (England) - In order to listen to what might be the only favourable voice in the chorus of the anti-smokers, one has to arrive here in this little town on the Thames. The man would could become the guardian angel of an army of harassed smokers is called David Warburton. In his laboratories, Professor Warburton of the Reading University has been studying for years the effects. of the substance ""nicotine"" on mental activities and has reached conclusions which contradict the surveys which in the United States relegate smokers to the lower levels of social class. According to Warburton, smokers are ambitious, curious and persevering people who use nicotine to better their Performances and their state of well-being. In this respect, the tests are quite clear: it only takes one ""puff"" to increase substantially the possibilities of success and the reaction time to graphic and mathematical problems which appear on the computer screen. The diagrams show that those who have not absorbed nicotine or smoked a cigarette ""placebo"" without nicotine, have a definitive breakdown of attention; those who smoke while exposed to the test have on the contrary quicker reactions and a higher concentration which increases as the level of nicotine rises. The higher the nicotine level, the better the response. It is useless, however, to increase that level over a certain threshold: it is accepted that the ""useful"" nicotine is of 10 nanograms for 1000 liters of blood. The same test used nicotine chewing gum with the same results but slower. The 1400 university students who took part in the research were also subjected to other tests. Warburton's team examined the results of the students’ exams per exam and on the whole, to reach the conclusion that all the students who ‘smoke have had better results during the course of the academic year and are notably more motivated than the others in their studies and in their career. According to Warburton, people who smoke do it to control their own mental and psychological state. Some smoke to calm themselves, others to work better or for both reasons. In fact, nicotine has a dual function of relaxation and stimulation comparable only to the effects of sexual activity. Tobacco increases the peaks of concentration, as caffeine or amphetamines but without provoking the anxiety which derives from the absorption of these two substances. It provokes the same state of relaxation as marijuana or Valium but stimulates attention at the same time- It has an 250120490?",9

"2070046123 Drug prevention money coup for Big Tobacco, critics claim June 4, 1999 By Greg Moore STAFF WRITER — =f State officials trumpeted a $4.5 million program Thursday that they say will help more than 21,000 West Virginia schoolchildren stay off tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. But some health advocates say West Virginia should have turned the money down, because it comes from tobacco companies and because the deal was brokered by a tobacco warehouse in Wéod County. The program, announced by Gov. Cecil Underwood and state schools Superintendent Henry Marockie, will provide $4.5 million over three years for the Life Skills Training program, West Virginia is the first state to implement the program statewide. Next year, more than 21,000 sixth-graders across the state will have 15 sessions under the program, urging them not to use tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. They will have 10 sessions as seventh-graders and five as eighth-graders. We need new options to prevent young people from falling into the grip of addiction to tobacco and other controlled substances,"" Underwood said during a press conference at Kanawha City Elementary School. ‘The two companies providing the $4.5 million, Philip Morris and Brown & Williamson, are two of the four tobacco companies who agreed last year to settle lawsuits by 46 states, The tobacco industry will pay the states more than $200 billion over 25 years, Marockie saluted the two businessmen who hooked the state up with the tobacco companies: Jack Bemheimer, president of Goldsmith-Black Co., and John Plesich, a consultant for the company. Goldsmith-Black is a grocery and tobacco warehouse in Wood County. In 1995, the company sued to prevent its local health department from enforcing a ban on smoking in indoor public places. A circuit judge threw the lawsuit out. ""This is the tobacco companies’ attempt to find legitimacy with adults,"" said Sara Crickenberger, executive director of the American Lung Association of West Virginia. ""This is selling our state's name to give the tobacco industry a good name. as",9

In the present study, we show that a single, 30 cGy dose of 150 keV/m 4He ions can malignantly transform human papillomavirus immortalized human bronchial epithelial [BEP2D] cells. Transformed cells produce progressively growing tumors in nude mice. The transformation frequency by the single dose of alpha particles is estimated to be approximately 4 X10*7. Based on the average cross-sectional area of BEP2D cells, it can be calculated that @ mean traversal of 1.4 particles per cell is sufficient to induce tumorigenic conversion of these cells 3 to 4 months post-itradiation, Tumorigenic BEP2D cells overexpress mutated p53 tumor suppressor ‘oncoproteins in addition to the cell cycle control gene cyclin DI and D2. This model provides an opportunity to study the cellular and molecular changes at the various stages in radiation carcinogenesis involving human cells INTRODUCTION ‘The natural radiation environment outside the magnetic shielding of the earth is rather ‘complex and consists of a mixed field of high energy protons, electrons, alpha particles and heavy ions. As the era of manned space exploration of our solar system becomes increasingly a reality rather than a myth, the potential exposure of astronauts to these high linear energy transfer [LET] radiations and the subsequent short and long term health effects on the crews become @ major concern of the space agency. The potential health problems facing the astronauts from high LET radiation in space include such late effects as cataract induction, gene and chromosomal mutations and carcinogenesis /1/. The principal stochastic risk associated with radiation exposure in space is cancer induction for which there is no human data base available /1,2/. In addition, accurate cisk assessment for human exposure to ionizing radiations has traditionally been compromised, in that reliable data are available only for substantial doses and extrapolations must be made down to the ow dose region of interest in radiation protection In vitro oncogenic transformation based on rodent cell models has been used to assess the carcinogenic potential of high LET radiations /3-5/. In particular, a single exposure to either high or low LET radiations has been used successfully to transform rodent cells in culture. High LET radiation, in general, is more efficient in transforming cells than X or y- rays at equivalent doses with a relative biological effectiveness that ranges from 2.2 10 10 / 40004733",6

Your first reaction might be to ignore this advice. Maybe you feel we're talking to you as if you were a child. And you probably don’t think of yourself that way.

Although ras genes are expressed in most marnsalian tissues and a mutated form of ras is found in many hursan tumors as well as in tumor Viruses (for reviews, see Barbacid, 1987; Lowy and Willumsen, 1986), their function in mammalian cells is unknown, The products of mammalian ras genes are stall ‘menibrane assuciated proceins (mol. wt 21 ka) which, like heterotrimeric GTP binding proteins (G proteins), ‘bind guanine nucleotides with high affinity and hydrolyze GTP. © Oxford University Press G proteins are activated by ligaral bound hormone receptors ‘which regulate the exchange reaction from GDP to GTP in 4 frst order reaction, The active (GTP bound) G protein then uctivates intracellular effectors (Gilman, 1987), Mammalian ray proteins too are helioved to mediate the transduction of an as yet unknown proliferative signal to an as yet unknown effector.  rovently reported candidate for the ras effector in mammmtalian cells isthe GTPase-activating protein (GAP) described by Tratsey and McCormick (1987: for review, see McCormick, 1989) Inthe yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae which cantains two RAS genes, the RAS effector is knows to be the adlenylyt cyclase (Toda et al, 1985).

"May 30, 1990 Mayor Donald M. Fraser 350 South Fifth Street, Room 127 Minneapolis, Minnesota 55415 Dear Mayor Fraser: Your city clerk, Merry Keefe, recently sent our company a copy of Resolution 90R-162, ""Urging R.J. Reynolds Company to cease planned cigarette advertising campaigns aimed at youth, people of color and young women."" On behalf of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and its 12,500 employees, I object to the fact that the Minneapolis government has passed a resolution that grossly misleads the public about our company and our products. First, you urge our company to stop doing something that we are not doing. We do not advertise or wish to promote our products to anyone under the age of 18. Nor do we have any interest or engage in any activity designed to encourage nonsmokers, regardless of age, to start smoking. Our company's sole focus is trying to convince current adult smokers that our brands are more desirable than those of our competitors. Reynolds Tobacco manufactures and markets a legal product that is enjoyed daily by 50 million Americans, and we don't need to make any excuses for what we do. If you are an adult who currently smokes, we want your business; if you are not, we don't. It simple as that, and anyone who accuses us of acting otherwise either misinformed or intentionally misrepresenting what we do. Second, concerning the resolution's accusations about ""people of color and young women,"" our products are marketed to all current adult smokers and are enjoyed by male and female adults of virtually every racial and ethnic background. In our opinion, your resolution is extremely patronizing to those individuals you purport to protect. You are assuming that these adults do not’ have the intelligence and common sense to make up their own minds about common lifestyle choices, such as smoking. Third, if you are going to accuse us of intentionally trying to take advantage of people and harm their health, you should present all of the facts, not just those that. support your bias. Your resolution states that ""numerous studies have demonstrated causal links between smoking and increased cases of cancer, coronary heart disease, chronic lung diseases and low birth weight babies 99S TLL05",0

Alameda Avenue Suite A214 Burbank, CA 91523 Dear Mr. Zucker: am disappointed to have to be writing you again for the second time in less than a ‘month about the use of one of our cigarette brands in a plot line on one of your highly- rated prime-time programs. In this instance, dialogue referring to our Newport brand -- along with a product tagline —- ‘was scripted into a scene of the program ""Frasier,"" on an episode entitled ""Cranes Go Caribbean"" which aired on Tuesday, May 22. Both the Newport name and tagline are registered trademarks of Lorillard. In the scene, a female character, seen smoking a cigarette, expresses to Kelsey Grammar's “""Prasier Crane"" character that ""this Newport is more alive with pleasure than you are.” As I explained in my previous letter -- sent after our Newport Lights brand was used as a plot point in a late-April airing of ""Friends"" -- Lorillard Tobacco Company has no desire to utilize any broadcast medium to promote our products. In fact, as you may recall, the Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 — which took effect in January 1971 — led to the elimination of all tobacco advertising on television and radio. In 1998, we voluntarily agreed to refrain from product placement in movies and television, a practice we already had abandoned decades ago. 97971066 Compote One: Mat 714 Green Valley Road PO.

LEWIS Department of Pathology, Huntingdon Research Cenire, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire PEV8 6ES (Accepted 1S August 1980) inrRopuction Cell renewal in the epithelium of the various levels of the respiratory tract does not occur at a uniform rate (Bertalanffy, 1968), instead it varies, even between cranial and caudal regions of the trachea (Bolduc & Reid, 1976). Several studies hhave investigated the mitotic activity in the rat trachea, bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli (Rertalanffy & LeBiond, 1953; Spencer & Shorter, 1962; Bertalanfty, 1964; Shorter, Titus & Divert, 1964: Shorter, Titus & Divertie, 1966; Blenkinsopp, 1967; Wells, 1970). However, no studies of mitotic activity of rat largyngeal epithelium hhave been traced. The larynx, in comparison with other regions of the respiratory tract, contains five distinct ‘epithelial types identifiable by electron microscopy: squamous, squamoid, respiratory and two cuboidal forms (Lewis & Prentice, 1980; Lewis, 1980), ‘The present study briefly describes the histological appearances of the various epithelial types from one micron sections and reports their mitotic indices in det MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty male, specific pathiogen-free CFHB Wistar-derived, albino rats (average weight 200) were obtained from Anglia Laboratory Animals, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. Immediately on arrival five rats were killed and the lungs, trachea and larynges examined histologically to assess the degree of chronic inflammatory cell infiltration, and therefore the suitability of the rats for experimentation. The remaining rats were maintained under strict barriered conditions for a 2 weeks acclimatization period, after which time four rats were given intraperitoneal injections of 0:1 mg per 190 g body weight of colchicine (Sigma Chemical Co., London) in sterile isotonic saline, The injections commenced at 10.00 am and successive animals were dosed at intervals of five minutes. Exactly 4 hours after the injection each rat was killed by an: intraperitoneal injection of sodium. pento- barbitone. In addition, one rat was given an intraperitoneal injection of isotonic saline as a vehicle control. This experiment with: four colchicine and one control rat was subsequently: repeated on six occasions. ‘The tongue, pharynx, larynx and trachea were removed. en masse and the larynx carefully dissected free, and fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde in 0-1 m cacodylate butfer, pH 73, at 4°C, for 3 hours.

"The Associated Press - March 7, 1962 London -- A committee from Britain's Royal College of Surgeons reported today after a tvo-year study that cigarette smoking may be a contributing cause of death from a mmber of diseases besides lung cancer. The nine physicians studied thousands of case histories and examined more than 200 other medical inquiries into smoking. Some of the conclusions Leaked out several weeks ago but the full 70-page report was not made Public until today. Here are some of the findings: Cigarette smoking is the most likely cause of the recent world-wide increase in deaths from lung cancer. ‘The habit probably increases the risk of death from coronary heart disease, particularly in early middle age. It may be particularly responsible for tuberculosis deaths among elderly men. Smoking may be @ contributory factor in cancer of the mouth, pharynx, esophagus and bladder. It may be a reason for the increased mortality from peptic ulcers. It is en important predisposing cause in development of chronic bronchitis. The report acknowledged that smoking may have psychological and social denefits. It confirmed findings of other medical groups that pipes and cigars are less dangerous than cigarettes, probably because the cigarette smoker inhales far more. The committee suggested that for health's sake the government should boost taxes on cigarettes and lower them on cigars and pipe tobacco. T2PEPOLOOT It also had a tip for cigarette smokers who cen't quit. ‘Throw avay 2 cigerette when it 1s half smoked because the unburned portion filters out most of the injurious matter. Sir Robert Platt, the chairman, told the news conference that 20,000 men in Britain died of lung cancer last year, and that deaths among wonen, 3,000 in 1961, are increasing. “It's the cigarette smoker who gets cancer of the lung,” Sir Robert said. “These facts ere unpleasant and are unpalatable, but they are facts."" The British Tobacco Manufacturers’ Standing Comittee promptly issued a statement saying it has cooperated with medical and scientific authorities in studying the relationship between health and smoking.

FOR RELEASE After 8:30 A.M., Wednesday, October 21, 1970 qu . COMMISSION ENFORCEMENT POLICY STATEMENT IN REGARD TO CLEAR AND CONSPICUOUS DISCLOSURE IN TELEVISION ADVERTISING The Commission in recent years has issued various opinions, orders and trade regulation rules that are concerned with the need for affirmative disclosures in connection with certain kinds of representations. These disclosures have been required, in general terms, to be “clear and conspicuous"". Because questions have been raised as to the specific meaning of the term ""clear and conspicuous"", the Commission deens it appropriate to set forth the standards it considers in determining whether, in fact, an affirmative disclosure in a television commercial 1s ""clear and conspicuous"". “I. In making this determination, the Conmission will take into consideration all the technical factors (size of letters, duration of disclosure, etc.) used in present ing the disclosure to a television audience as well as the substance of the individual disclosure. Specifically, the Commission believes that each of the following specific Standards should be met for a television disclosure to be deemed clear and conspicuous: A, The disclosure should be presented simultaneously in both the audio and video portions of the television advertisement. B. The video portion of the disclosure must contain letters of sufficient size 80 that it can be easily seen and read on all television sets, regardless of s Picture tube size, that are commercially available for the consuming public. C. The video portion of the disclosure should contain letters of a color or shade that readily contrast with the background. The background should consist of only one color or shade. 1005045960 (more) ra no os pica a hee Be se",9

I is posible to embed freeze-dried tissue in low icosity resins, either at rom temperature or at subzoro temporatures in Spure's resin or Lowieryl KAM, respectively. The choice of embedding medium ‘affords additional flexibility in pastdrying and embedding conditions, since SSpurr’s resin allows vapor fixation with osmium tetroxide and thermal poly- ‘merization, Osmitum tetroxide is not recommended for Lowieryl resins, but these media permit polymerization at subzero temperatures with ultraviolet Tight. Both resins have unique advantages that may be utilized, depending ""upon the purpose of the embedding. In this paper, we diseuss the details of preparing smooth muscle, from rabbit renal artery, by quick freezing and freezedrying, as well as methods for the embedding of the freeze-dried tissue in both Spurr’s resin and Lowery! K4M. ‘Although we have previously reported the ultrastructure of smooth muscle tmbedded in Spurr's low viscosity vesin, the combination of freezedrying and infileration in Lowieryl K4M represents « new approach that allows the elimi: nation of chemical fixation, dehydration with organic solvents, ané heat poly merization of the embedding medium.

Antigenic sites do not. survive osmium tetroxide fixation (Roth et al., 198, land the preservation of enzymatic and anti xenic activities by aldehydes is highly vari- ble (Hayat, 1981); aldehyde fixation may also induce osmotic damage to the specimen (for a review see Lee, 1984). Also dehydration and infiltration usually rely on organic sol- vents to replace the aqueous phase with a liquid, polymerizable embedding medium. ‘These represent major changes in the envi- ronments of ells and tissues. Although there © 1987 ALAN INC, have been recent advances in low tempera ture embedding techniques (Armbruster et al,, 1982, 1984; Carlemalm et al, 1982) and removable embedding media (Capco et al, 1984; Wolosewiek, 1980, 1984), the majority of these methods still rely on some form of chemical fixation andor dehydration. ‘One method of bypassing chemical fixation is to rapidly freeze the specimen. In its sim- plest definition, rapid freezing sidered as “physical fxation,” objective is to instantaneously stop all biolog ical processes and to preserve the living state.

"RIR Prep siesiical Support Project Summary PROJECT NAME: Summary of Wrinkles in Winston Light 100's STATISTICIAN NAME: Michael J. Morton CLIENT NAME: Clifford R. Marritt COMPLETION DATE: April 25, 1986 1, INTRODUCTION ‘As part of the investigation of wrinkled cigarettes, samples of product were taken at Whitaker Park and inspected for wrinkles.! These samples were taken of Winston Light 100’s from 4 MK- 9/AMF's and from 3 Protos/GD's. The purpose of these samples was 1. to estimate the extent of the wrinkling problem 2, to estimate the importance of various sources of variability 8, to get a rough estimate of differences between the ‘MK-9/AMF and the Protos/GD. ton Light 100's because it is the brand etyle with the best mix of ‘MK-9/AMF""'s and Protos/GD's. Samples were taken from the maker mass flow (100 cigarettes) and from the packer (6 packs). The data was gathered under the direction of Roy Foster an Dave Robertson. This report summarizes the findings from those samples. ‘Samples were taken from Wit A listing of the data that was gathered is given in Table 1. The values at the maker are the number of wrinkled cigarettes from a sample of 100 and the values at the packer are the number of wrinkled cigarettes per pack. A summary of the data is given in Table 2. We note several things from Table 2. 1, There are few wrinkled cigarettes at the maker. 2. There is a considerably larger number of wrinkles at the packer. 3. There is considerable machine-to-machine variation, 4. The proportion of wrinkles at the Protos/GD is less than at the MK-9/AMF. That difference, as we note below, is not statistically significant; however, it is based on a emall sample of machines and further eampling may show the observed differences to be “real.” (Note that, the machine with the second fewest wrinkled cigarettes is a MK-9/AMF machine.) 5. There is a problematically large number of wrinkles from both the Protos/GD and the MK- 9/AMF machines. 2. ANALYSIS Firet we examine the wrinkles at the packer. ‘This is to quantify the several componente of variance. The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 3. Table 3 shows that we cannot conclude that the Protos/GD is significantly different from the MK-9/AMF. However, there is a difference between machines and there is a difference from sample time to sample time within a machine, All 3 sources of variation look to be of comparable size. T As defined by the Wrinkled Cigarette working committee, a wrinkle is a transverse indentation around one-half or more of the cigarette. 1ee7s 6ese",0

I also would like to present my view on the relationship between environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure and lung cancer. DEFINITION OF HEALTH “ Although health is by nature both a holistic and universal concept, its meaning can differ greatly with an individual's age, living environment, and working attitude in society. The concept of health is therefore an-extremely personal matter, and any definition must be svitebly broad and flexible, Recently, with the decline of infectious diseases, diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease have become a matter of foremost concern. Although these diseases have theit main sites in one or @ emall number of tissues or organs, most are thought to be the result of an accumulation of causes expanding over a long period and affecting the entire system, Nor can the profound relationship between these diseases and individual life-style be denied. In cerrying out @ health care program, each individual must review his or her life-style from holistic perspective, based on a full understanding of health science. Along this view, the decision whether to have controlled smoking or any smoking at all ix entirely up to each individual by considering his or her own personal preferences and the influences of smoking on health. Through such judgement, one will be able to lead a healthy life ADVERSE AND PHARMACOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF NICOTINE EXPOSURE ‘coin. the main active pharmacological substance absorbed into the body throuxh stone on both the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system. ‘Among its effects on the periphoral nervous system, nicotine is known to increase the heart rate, 10 raise the blood pressure, and to lower the skin temperature by conttacting the skin's blood vessels by first stimulating then blocking the autonomic ganglia. It also accelerates the motility of the intestinal tract, increases gastric secretions, and decreases food consumption. These effects grow less strong through repeated udministration, producing @ phenomenon known as acute tolerance, ‘Among its effects on the central nervous system, nicotine has long been known to cause convulsions, but it is becoming clear that nicotine produces a variety of other psychotrophie effects as well. For example, it has a biphasic action that produces a stimulating or a sedative effect depending on the state of the body at the time it is taken. It also acts to improve performance in a variety of tasks. Furthermore, the sense of satisfaction derived from administering nicotine can create a drug seeking for more, i., peychological dependence. The degree of dependence is far milder than that produced by narcotics such as heroin or by stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines, and any physical dependence is incomparably weaker than that of heroin. CARCINOGENIC EFFECTS OF TOBACCO TAR AND TOBACCO SMOKE ‘Tumor-producing aromatic hydrocarbons and various kinds of nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic substances, have been detected in tobacco tar. Recently, it was reported that tumor-producing heterocyclic amines, which ate found in heat-processed foods, have also been detected in tobacco tar. Because it has been demonstrated that both benign and malignant skin tumors are developed by the Jong-term application of tobacco tar to the skin of experimental animals, studies have been conducted in which tobacco smoke was forcibly administered to animals, but it has proved extremely difficult to produce lung cancer through tobacco smoke alone. The abnormalities (squamous metaplasia), 1... the hypertrophy, deformation, and proliferation of the epithelial cells that line the trachea and bronchi ‘and that are known to be precancerous are said to be smoking related. But there are several phases in this procese. and not all abnormalities in the initial stages necessarily progress any further. TS EXPOSURE AND LUNG CANCER The reintionship between exposure to ETS and lung cancer was advocated by Hirayama (Jepan) and ‘Trichopoulos (Greece) in 1981.

"April 24, 1991 The Reverend Jesse W. Brown, Jr. Christ Evangelical Lutheran Church 3006 West Diamond Street Philadelphia, PA 19121 Dear Rev. Brown: I want to thank you for your friendship and make you aware of two R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company programs that reflect an important part of our heritage: commitment to responsible corporate citizenship. Through the years, we have dewonstrated a high level of commitment in many ways, but two current programs are among the most meaningful ever implemented. The first is a multifaceted effort by the entire tobacco industry to discourage smoking by young people. Coordinated by the Tobacco Institute, this program was unveiled on December 11, 1990, at a press conference in Washington, D.C. To extend and reinforce this program's message, Reynolds Tobacco has developed advertisements (see enclosures) that will run in nearly 300 Black and Hispanic newspapers around the country. The second program is also nationwide in scope. It will heighten public awareness of national Black and Hispanic organizations that are working to overcone problems that disproportionately affect minorities. Our 1990 public service outdoor campaign promoted the Opportunities Industrialization Centers of America (OIC), National Urban League, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and United Negro College Fund (UNCF) on 900 billboards in 42 cities. The 1991 program will again support the Urban League and NAACP, as well as the NAAGP Legal Defense Fund. In addition, we will display billboards to recognize the vital work of The Southwest Voter Registration Education Project (SVREP), National Council of La Raza (NCLR) and SER-Jobs for Progress. The value of this billboard program to these organizations for 1990 and 1991 is well over §2 million. If you would like additional information about either of these programs, or any other Reynolds Tobacco activities, please don’t hesitate to call. Warmest personal regards, Benjamin $.

"The Effect of Cigarette Smoke Condensate on Rabbits’ Cardiovascular Cells in Vitro’ R. Kotor axb ©. J. Poutax Dover Medial Rrsarch Centr, Ine, Dover, Dilovort Received Inte 10, 2082 INTRODUCTION Previous studies disclosed that addition of nicotine to rabbits’ sonic and mye ‘cardial cells in vitro caused successively increased cytoplasmic granulation, vacuoisa- tion, nuclear pyknosis. and cytolysis. Aortic “endothelial” celle were more vulnerable than ““Sbrocytic™ cells. Myocardial cells were more vulnerable thin spindle cells which grew from aortic explants. Cells ftom hypercholesteremic rabbits were more sensitive than analogous cells trom normocholesteremic animals. Inhibition of pro- liferation and cellular alterations were commensurate with nicotine concentration and length of exposure to nicotine. as reported by Kokubu and Pollak (1962) In discussing the posible link betweent smoking and vascular disease. one must beat in mind that nicotine is but one of multiple constituents of tobacco and tobacco: smoke. We decided to utilize tissue cultutes to investigate this link, in spite of the obvious difficulty to extrapolate in vitro studies and én wiv conditions. Extension of tissue culture experiments to substances other than ‘nicotine was imperative. This report concerns the effect of cigarette smoke condensate on rabbits’ cardiovascular MATERIALS AND METHODS ‘The culture techniques employed in this study’ were the same as those wed berore by Kokobu and Pollak (1961). Composite cigarette smoke condensate was obtained from a source conforming to the standards of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, Eath mm of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) prepared from five regular. standard size cigarettes contained 15 mp of nicotine (N Following the same recommended method of preparation. comparable condensates ‘were prepared by us from repular vntipped, denicotinized untipped. Alter Upped. and Genicotinized filter tipped cigaretes. Since the toxicty of pure nicotine for i wtro cardiovascular cells from rabbits thad been determined previously by Kokubu and Pollak (1962). the stength of the various preparations of cigarette smoke condensates was adjusted on the basi of nicotine ‘content. Thus, any effect of CSC exceeding tha of compartble nicotine solution could be ascribed to substances other than nicotine. ‘The intial preparation consisted of 100 ml of Eagle's basal medivm with 0.66.1 1 Tih sudy was sopsorted by reeeeh aramts from the National Meer Iite EOD 07 ‘1 and trom te Tokacco Inds Research Commitee PUBLICATIONS 029786",6

Key words: bovine forebrain/dexetimide/ digitonin Introduction ‘The neurotransmitter acetylcholine elicits rapid responses by interacting with nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) and slower effects via muscarinic receptors (mACHRs). Muscarinic responses are observed in the central and peripheral nervous, system as well as in muscle and in glands and representa large Proportion of the acetylcholine-mediated effects, Due to the extraordinarily high number of nAChRs found in the post synaptic membrane of the electromotor synapses of electric fish, knowledge of the mechanism and structure of nACHRS. hhas increased tremendously in recent years (Changeux, 1981). ‘Advances in research on mACHRs have been much less rapid. This is due to the lower concentration of mACARS, together with the fact that these receptors have not yet been purified. Earlier radioligand binding studies revealed that mACHRS are discrete membrane components which recognize an- tagonist and agonist molecules (Gorissen et al, 1978; Birdsall, et al., 1979; Haga, 1980). As is the case with many other receptor systems, the two types of ligands appear to differ in their mechanisms of interaction in the following way: only agonists induce receptor desensitization in intact cell prepara- tions (Klein et al., 1979; Simon and Klein, 1979); the recep tors are composed of different subpopulations with the same affinity for antagonists but different affinities for agonists (Birdsall e¢ al, 1978; Ehlert et a., 1981); guanine nucleotides ‘To whom rep requss shoud be sent © IRL Press Limo, Oxford, England, and Mg?* ions have opposite effects on agonist affinity but ‘no effect on antagonist binding (Ehlert er ai., 1981; Wei and Sulakhe, 1980; Sokolovsky et ai., 1980); and finally, agonists but not antagonists induce conformational changes in the receptors (Vauquelin et al, 1982). 'mACARS have been successfully solubilized with a wide variety of detergents, of which digitonin appears to be the ‘most effective (Gorissen et al., 1981; Ruess and Lieflander, 1979; Hurko, 1978; Aaronstam etal, 1978; Repke and Mat thies, 1980). ‘An affinity gel with high affinity for mACHRS (Repke et al, 1980) has been described recently and a Durifcation of hydrophobic MACHR and nACHR proteins ‘was attempted earlier (Barrantes ef al, 1975). We report here the first successful purification of mACHRS, These receptors were solubilized with digitonin, purified by absorption on an affinity get with dexetimide followed by selective elution with the MACHR antagonist atropine or with the highly specific Inreversible ligand propylbenzilyicholine mustard (PrBCM). ‘The radioiodinated purified proteins were analysed by SDS- polyacrytamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Results Ligand binding characteris of the membrane-bound and solubilized mACHRS 55 a 10% membrane proteins and 15 + 5% of the total specie PH}dexetimide o PH}qunueldng!benzlate (QNB) binding activity were recovered in the supernatant of 3 190 (9) diatoninstested membrane suspension, ‘The equilbrium saturation binding data of studies on membrane-bound (a) and solubilized (¢) ACHRS wih PH\dexeimide are given in Figure 1A and B, respectively.

Reynolds Tobacco Co., Philip Morris USA, and Ge the Tobacco Institute have introduced youth-oriented education € Y \ programs on smoking. But critics simply do not buy into the companies’ claims that they do not want young people to use or buy sent their products. ""We find their efforts to be insincere at best and ( ees \ harmful at worst,"" says Michael Eriksen, director of the federal Orfice R chord) on Smoking and Health. In fact, some tobacco foes insist that the tol ‘way in which companies present smoking in these tobacco education programs~-as a privileged decision reserved for adults only~actually increases adolescent smoking. Dr. Joseph R. DiFranza and a colleague caused a sti when they concluded that the campaigns encourage tobacco use. ""Children who might never have considered tobacco use to be an option are taught that they must make a decision about using tobacco,” DiFranza wrote. ""Not surprisingly, some decide to try it"" Dr. Thomas J. Glynn of the National Cancer Institute agrees. “Anyone who has kids 12 to 15 years old at home knows that telling them an activity is for adults only is the surest way to get them to try it."" RJ. Reynolds has especially been blasted for its ""Right Decisions, Right Now"" brochure for adolescents, which does not use the Joe Camel cartoon mascot to deliver the anti-smoking message. Critics say if RJR really wanted to eliminate youthful smoking, it would use Joe Camel to do so. ""If they were serious, they could use Joe Camel's imagery to get the message out to kids not to smoke,” says Eriksen. Passive Smoking Affects Children, Women, Studies Say* Reuters (02/03/94) London—Two studies to be published Friday in the British Medical Journal report that secondhand smoke leaves physical traces in children and can cause heart disease in women. In the first study, Chinese researchers at the University of Hong Kong and the military ‘medical university in Xian found that women whose husbands smoked were twice as likely to develop coronary heart disease. ‘Women whose co-workers smoked were two-and-a-half times more likely to develop the disease. The researchers said, ""Passive ‘smoking at work is a risk factor for coronary heart disease. Urgent public health measures are needed to reduce smoking and to protect non-smokers from passive smoking in China.” In the second study, researchers coordinated by epidemiologist Derek Cook of St. George's Hospital Medical School in London found that children ‘exposed to passive smoke had clear by-products of tobacco nicotine in their saliva. The survey of more than 2,000 children measured levels of nicotine by-product cotinine in the saliva. The researchers ‘wrote, “Our data confirm that parental smoking is the most important source of passive exposure to smoke in young children...

"Effects of Residual : Tobacco Smoke on Nonsmokers J.R. White Introduction . ‘There is increasing evidence that more smokers than nonsmokers die prematurely from coronary disease. But nonsmokers who involuntarily inhale residual tobacco smoke (any and all smoke from tobacco, whether from the cigarette, cigar or pipe or from the exhalation of the smoker) experience nasal congestion, eye irritation, headache, nausea and gastric upset, and the smoke can be particu: larly harmful to nonsmokers with cardiorespiratory and allergy problems, a sizable group of between 8 and 34 million Americans (Zussman, Journal of Asthma Research, June 1974, and Banzhaf, Today's Health, April 1972). Definitive evidence that inhaling residual smoke constitutes a health hazard to otherwise healthy nonsmokers has not as yet appeared in the literature. However, a reasonable hypothesis is that when a nonsmoker is exposed to residual smoke, he will experience adverse physiological resporises. This paper presents an analysis of cardiac, pulmonary and neural changes caused by inhalation of residual tobacco smoke. These changes are simultaneously reflected in each of the following parameters: ‘ 1. Minute volume (VE) 2. Oxygen consumption (VO2) 3. Oxygen consumption/kg 4. Carbon dioxide production (VCO2) 5.RQ. 6. Respiratory rate 7. Perspiration production 8. Heart rate 9. Systolic blood pressure 8620STO00 4. R.

Cardiovascular Aspects of Sleep Apnea (a) Hypertension and Sleep Apnea Chemoreflexes— Responses, Interactions and Implications for Sleep Apnea Virend K. Somers and Francois M. Abboud Department of lnternal Medicine and Cardiovascular Center, University of lov'a College of Medicine, Towa City, fowa, US. Hypoxia and hypercapnia impose circulatory and metabolic stresses on the body. Responses to these sresses include both local and reflex mechanisms that attempt to restore homeostasis and maintain perfusion of the most vital and sensitive organs, such as the brain and the heart. Increased ventilation, which is a reflex response, aims to restore normoxia and/or normocap- nia. Both hypoxia and hypercapnia also exert local vasodilatory effects. Chemorefiex-mediated sympa thetic vasoconstriction acts in opposition to the local vasodilatory effects, except in the cerebral and coro- nary circulations. Thus, the integrated response con- sists of hyperventilation, peripheral vasoconstriction and cerebral and coronary vasodilation. This inte- grated response is further influenced by other factors, including ventilation itself, interactions between hyp- xia and hypercapnia, the severity of hypoxia and oth- erreflexes, such asthe arterial baroreflexes. This review will examine the role of the chemoreflexes in the re- sponses to hypoxia and hypercapnia, interactions that significantly modulate the chemoreflex responses and the importance of the chemoreflexes in mediating the cardiovascular responses to sleep apnea. (CHEMOREFLEX RESPONSES TO HYPOXIA AND HYPERCAPNIA Hypoxia, by stimulation of the peripheral chemo- receptors in the carotid bodies (1,2), results ini creased minute ventilation, increased sympathetic ac- tivation to peripheral blood vesselsand increased vagal discharge to the heart (3). Other reflex responses to peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation include choli ergic vasodilation of coronary blood vessels (4) and noncholinergic vasodilation of cutaneous blood vessels (5) Peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation does not ap- pear to affect cerebral blood vessels, which vasodilate due 10 the local effects of hypoxia (6,7). In humans, ‘evidence that the peripheral chemoreceptors ate the primary mediators of the reflex responses to hypoxia are based on data showing that carotid body cener- vation and resection result in an elimination of the ventilatory response to hypoxia, At very tow levels of oxygen tension, however (PO, < 40 mm Hg), hypoxia elicits a central pressor reflex resulting in increases in systemic arterial pressure (8-10). Furthermore, at ex- tremely low levels of oxygen tension, failure of vaso- motor regulatory control may result in widespread cir- culatory collapse. Hypercapnia acts via central chemoreceptors (11).

"o- MAS November 10, 1977 Mr. B. G. Swaine Re: COUPON MISREDEMPTION It has been observed that some retailers have submitted for repayment groups of coupons containing an unusually long block of consecutively numbered coupons. It is possible that such blocks occur’ by chance even when no misredemption is present. However, very long such blocks suggest that one person has xedeemed the coupons without purchasing the item. One would like to know what lengths of blocks of consecutively numbered coupons are likely to be honestly redeemed just by chance. We could then point to apparent cases of misredemption and say such blocks of coupon numbers are unlikely to have been honestly redeemed. We now have a formula to compute the appropriate probabilities. (See the technical appendix for the assumptions, derivation, and the formula.) The following is a table of values of the lengths which have a one-in-10,000 chance of being met or exceeded by a block of consecutively numbered redeemed coupons when no misredemp- tion is present. Number Of Coupons Available For Possible Redemption By The Retailer 1,000 10,000 += 100,000 Redemption 2.58 4 5 6 Rate At The 5.0 ® 6 7 Retailer 765 6 7 8 10.0 7 8 9 For example, suppose that 1,000 coupons were distributed in the neighborhood of a particular retailer and that 50 of these were actually redeemed, giving a redemption rate of 5%. The appropriate value (it is circled) from the table is 5. If the retailer submits for repayment a block of 5 or more consecutively numbered coupons, then misredemption is suspected. 90S2 snoos",0

Phorbol ester ‘and okadaic acid regulation of Na-2CI-K cotransport in rabbit tracheal epithelial cells.Am. J. Physiol. 271 (Cell Physiol. 40): ‘C838-C346, 1996.—We evaluated a role for protein kinase C (PKC) in the regulation of rabbit tracheal epithelial Na-Cl(K) cotransport, Short-term treatment with phorbol 12-myristate S-avetate (PMA) dose dependently increased bumetanide- sensitive Na and Cl efflux and elevated staurosporine- and >bumetanide-sensitive Na, Cl, and K uptake. PMA and the ayvadrenergic agonist guanabenz both induced cotransport with a stoichiometry of 2 Cl:1 Na and 2 Cl:1 Rb and elevated staurosporine-sensitive PKC activity in cytosolic and particu- late fractions. Prolonged PMA treatment did not sustain bumetanide-sensitive 2 Cl:1 Na and 2 Cl:1 Rb transport but did block stimulation of bumotanide-sensitive transport by PMAor guanabent and elevation of PKC activity by PMA and guanabenz in a particulate fraction. Cells treated with oka- daic acid exhibited a staurosporine- and bumetanide-sensi- tive 2 Cl:1 Na and 2 CL: Rb uptake. In cultured monolayers, basolateral perfusion with epinephrine, isoproterenol, or PMAincroasod ehort-cirouit eurrent ([y)-Basolateral applica- tion of bumetanide reduced elevated J. to baseline levels, indicating a role for Cl secretory cells in a reconstituted tracheal epithelium, Pretreatment of transmonolayer cul ‘tures with PMA diminished the stimulatory response to epinephrine. These results indicate that, in rabbit tracheal epithelial cells, a-adrenergic stimulation activated Na-2C1-K at PKG is a critical effector in this process. ‘a-adrenergic receptors; loop diuretics; bumetanide; protein phosphatase; guanabenz; epinephrine; clonidine; transmono- layer cultures; staurosporine; protein kinase C ‘ONE MODE OF TRANSPORTING the electrolytes Na and Cl ‘that is common to many cell types is cotransport of the electrolytes Na and Cl, which is directly coupled to the inwardly directed Na electrochemical gradient as the driving force for Cl uptake. An additional requirement for K is seen in some cells under specific stimulatory conditions, such as, for example, vasopressin stimula tion of mouse medullary thick ascending limb (82). We have previously shown that Na-Cl cotransport in hu- man and rabbit tracheal epithelial cells is activated by a-adrenergic agonists (15) and hyperosmotic challenge (16). The Ca ionophore ionomycin mimics the response too-adrenergie stimulation. Other studies show second- ary activation of cotransport in canine tracheal epithe- lial cells, which is mediated by agents that stimulate cal Cl channels to induce Cl secretion (10, 11). These studies correlated stimulation of salt secretion by isopro- terenol, ATP, and UTP to the equilibrium level of saturable, basolateral bumetanide-binding sites. The caa8 finding of increased bumetanide binding with induction of Cl secretion was interpreted as upregulation of cotransport in Cl secretory cells. Our finding of direct activation of cotransport by a adenosine 3',5'-eyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-indepen- dent mechanism led to detailed studies of the intracel- lular signaling of the a-adrenergic stimulation. The studies first focused on effectors involved in Ca-dependent mecha- nisms for signal transduction. The results demonstrate a-adrenergic activation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate (Ptdins(4,5)Pz}-specific phospholipase C with subsequent hydrolysis of Ptdine(4,5)P, to two intracellular second messengers, inositol phosphate (17) and diacylglycerol (18). The transient nature of mediator release within a time frame that coincides with cotransporter activation suggested a link between Ca and diacylglycerol. These two intracellular media- tors are activators for some isotypes of protein kinase C (PKC; Ref. 31). PKC subsumes a family of at least 10 subtypes, some of which require Ca for activation (26, 31), PKC has been linked to the regulation of other electrolyte trans- porters, including cation and anion exchangers that operate during cell volume regulation, salt absorption, and pH regulation and ion channels that are required for secretion, in particular an apical Cl channel (2, 4,6). ‘A useful tool in identifying and characterizing PKC regulation is phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), phorbol ester that activates PKC (31). The effects PMA often show a time dependence that is interpreted as resulting from activation (early) or downregulation Cate) of PKC. For example, with some ion exchangers, such as Na/H or CVHCO, (of thyroid and Vero cells, respectively), short-term treatment with PMA acti- vates ion exchange, whereas long-term treatment with PMA, which chronically activates PKC, fails to alter electrolyte transport through ion exchangers (22, 34). In the latter instance, chronic activation of PKC leads ‘to downregulation due to increased sensitivity to prote- lysis (81). Short-term PMA treatment can induce opposing responses, as seen in intestinal and renal epithelial cells (35). In these cells, Ne/H exchangers found on apical membranes are inhibited by PMA, which produces an opposite effect of stimulation on cation exchangers in the basolateral surface. PMA also influences the activity of Na-Cl-K eotrans- porters in epithelial and nonepithelial cells. Fibro- blasts (27, 30), endothelial cells (26), and osteoblasts (88) express a cotransporter that is sensitive to PMA, ‘thus suggesting regulation through PKC.

Using novel, biophysical convolution model to remove subject-specific metabolic clearance rates, we have now estimated spontaneous ae secreory events in vive. The later were characterized by prominent ultadian rhythms of dis screory bursts with prides averaging 32, 46,76, and 130 mia. These ulzadian cortisol see. shyt represented a 17- to 240-fld larger faction of circadian seretory variations than dd contol ‘concenttionshythms. We conclude that deconvolution analysis can unmask underlying ulead stythms in adrenal secretory activity én vivo. Physiological cicadian and ultradian rhythms in plasma cortisol concentrations have been recognized in a variety of animal species under various conditions of health and disease (Perkoff et al., 1959; Onh etal, 1967; Hellman et al., 1970; Weitzman ct al., 1971; Srivastva and Meier, 1972; Walter-Van Cauter et al., 1981; Ottenveller et al., 1986; Krieger ahd Aschoff, 1989). Such rhythms in the circulating concentrations of glucocorticoid hormone are associated with major adaptive responses of organisms to environmental cues, sre and other externally originating and intemally derived stimuli (Krieger and Aschoff, 198 ‘Variations in blood cortisol concentrations overtime are assumed to confer varying degrees ‘of agonist exposure to the target cell. However, such temporal oscillations in plasma glu- <cocorticoid concentrations do not directly reveal the physiological nature of adrenal glandular secretory activity, since plasma hormone concentrations result from the combined operation of secretory events and endogenous subject-specific metabolic clearance rates (Veldhuis| et al., 1987; Urbanet al, 1988). Accordingly, despite the vast experimental literature describ th tegration cori] concent ht ae he wget lod te is relatively litle knowledge of the nyetohemeral and ultradian features of adrenal cortical secretory events per se. Such information is of interest, since regulation of endocrine glandular secretory rhythms can be anticipated in various settings. |.

Care was taken that the age distribution and the body weight distribution of the exper- imental animals was approximately the same for the study of each of the three types of cigarettes. The results are shown on Table J. It is clearly evident that smoke from both types 207 and 213 cigarettes is considerably less toxic than that of IR1 Kentucky reference control cigarettes; these differences are highly significant by statistical criteria with a confidence level far below 0. 1% (t values of 5.83 and 5.98, respectively).

There's a bill before the Washangton State Senate that would be @ major problem for your business if it passed. This bill, called $86457, sets up unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions on tobacco product merchandising. It is one of the most intrusive bills ever, giving government bureaucrats new authoraty over your business. in fact, for the first time, state bureaucrats would be given the right to make rules that affect your tobacco merchanidising. Right now, at least, your state legislators have authority over these bureaucr: But if $8645? passes, unelected bureaucrats will have the full authority, not your elected officials. And with full rvle-making authority, there is no telling what kind of regulations will be next. Please protect your oun business and help stop this bill today. Your state senator is on a key committee that will vote on this bill within the next two days. That's why it's urgent that you leave a message for Senator orge hin to vote against SB6457, the tobacco regulation bill.

This group meets once a year for a Social Hour and Dinner at the University Club in New York and a thousand-bird pheasant release thé next day. Our Tenth Anni- versary will be on March 3 and 4, 1961. To the dinner at the University Club we usually invite from twenty-five to thirty New York bankers and textile machinery officials, and we always have some attractive favors. It has occurred tome that your company might have a cigarette that we could help promote. I recently received frau yepeee Hedges a Lucite box contain- ing two packages of ‘S°- this, and the fact that I recently read the article about you in the New York Times gave birth to the idea. Mac and I both read the article with much pride. In our company we have an artist who is very good at drawing designs and coloring and if you have anything that you think would be appropriate I would be glad to have a card printed and colored to go along with it - and do everything possible to promote your product. Perhaps you might have a jingle that would be appropriate. We also issue a newspaper called the Lint-Head Edition and I am enclosing a couple of copies along with some other literature for your information. This year, Dick Kleberg and Tobin Armstrong will join us again, and I am sure you know a number of our group who will be present at the dinner, and if you could join us for this portion of the festivities, we would certainly be delighted to have you.

He served as executive director of the American Cancer So- ciety for five yearsand pub- lished a report six years be- fore the 1854 U.S, Surge Sent to Ad Hoc & Staff General's report, reaching the same conclusions — namely, that smoking causes ung cancer and 2 host of other respiratory diseases. Dr. Carr, clinical professor of ‘thoracic surgery and founder of the Thoracic Sur- gery Association, told. the House Commerce Committee that assuming for argu- ‘ment's sake that only cigaret smokers developed lung can- cer, that with about 70 mil- lion smokers in the nation, there would only be one death per 1,400 smokers.

"RELIABILITY OF SELF REPORTING QUESTIONNAIRES FOR DETERMINING PASSIVE EXPOSURE TO CIGARETTE SMOKE IN OFFICE ENVIRONMENTS A White Paper By David A, Sterling Demetrios J. Moschandreas Increased amount of publications and advocate advertising on the health effects of smoking has led to the growing concern of nonsmokers on potential effects of passive exposure to cigarette smoke. To assess this potential exposure, researchers have used several scientific instruments, prevalent ‘among them are individual self reporting or interview questionnaires. Asking people how many cigarettes they smoke, or nonsmokers how many cigarettes are smoked near them, may seem a reasonable approach. However discrepancies between estimated consumption through questionnaire surveys, and actual number consumed have been reported around 30 percent, !»? It is suspected that a large portion of the discrepancy is due to the tendency of respondents to systematically underreport benavidr or events which may be perceived as undesirable. Although it has not been investigated, there may also be a tendency of nonsmokers to overreport their perceived exposure to cigarette smoke. Correction factors have been developed and used on smoking data to approximate actual rates.? If nonsmokers also show a systematic reporting bias {t may be possible to develope another set of such correction factors. There is a need for focused research to determine the reliability of using questionnaires for assessing passive exposure to cigarette smoke. IITRI proposes an investigation to assess the reliability of self reporting ques~ tionnaires. Specifically we will address questionnaires on smoking behavior, which are typically used in indoor air quality studies, for assessing possible exposure to cigarette smoke of non smokers in public environments. The investigation will attempt to determine the variation around a “true number"" of reported cigarettes consumed by smokers and reported exposed to by nonsmokers.

"WILMINGTON, N.C- STAR $. 30,968 9. 27,280"" = S. 205 vtiuncion METoROiTaN Me : 7 1963 ‘The Federal Communication Com- mission's proposal to ban cigarette advertising on radio and television is one of the most dangerous sug- gestions to come out of a ‘Washington bureau in years. THIS ABSURD move is based on the FCC's assertion that smoking is “a most serious, unique danger to public health.” Obviously, six of the seven members of the Com- mission have accepted as a fact a highly controversial report. The Commission points to statistics of the U. S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare which blame smoking for the deaths of many Americans. These statistics have been challenged since the time they were issued. But this is not the major aspect of the deplorable pro- posel by the FCC. What it wants is to compromise the principle of free speech, as represented by advertising and, in doing so, en- courage the restraint of legitimate trade, ‘The point we wish to emphasize is simply. this: Commodities or articles which are Jegal in the eyes of tho laws of our Republic — and rettes certainly are legal — should not be subjected to any restraint as to their advertising in Ee ale Ja Dangerous Proposal any form their makers wish.” After all, the principle the FCC {s following as to cigarettes could be applied to many othiér products, And if and when it is applied, then advertising — one of the major assets of the free enterprise system = would be entirely under the con. trol of bureaucrats and politicians, Thus, when one looks ahead, the danger of the FCC proposal is magnified greatly. CHAIRMAN HYDE has said he 4s confident his agency will have the legal authority to enforce a Cigarette advertising ban when the 1965 Cigarette Labeling and Advertising act expires on July 1, Under this law, both the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission are prohibited from taking any action to regulate cigarette advertising. Expecting a full congressional review of the smoking controversy after July 1, Mr. Hyde said “it is a matter in’ which Congress will be the final arbitor, When the time comes for Congress to make its decision, its answer would be a wholehearted and emphatic “No!” to the latest FCC proposal. Otherwise American freedom of speech and free en- terprise will suffer one of the most serious setbacks in modern times, cS B p a 3 ©",9

"MMWR PLUS Friday June 12, 1987 INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES FACILITIES BECOME SMOKE-FREE Tobacco, originally a Western Hemisphere plant, was used for ceremonies by many American Indians, especially those on the Northern Plains, before the Europeans arrived (1). Its current use by American Indians and Alaskan Natives varies greatly. American Indians from the Southwest smoke very little tobacco, whereas those from the Northern Plains and Alaskan Natives have substantially higher smoking rates than the general U.S. population (Table 1). The mortality rates due to smoking-related diseases in the areas served by the Indian Health Service (IHS) correlate with the differences in smoking prevalence (Table 2). The IHS, which is a component of the Health Resources and Services Administration of the Public Health Service (PHS), has comprehensive responsibilities for the health care of approximately 937,000 American Indians and Alaskan Natives. Facilities include 45 hospitals with a total of 1,989ds 65 health centers, and many field clinics throughout the United States American Indian/Alaskan Native groups also administer six hospitals and numerous clinics through a federally funded tribal program under Public Law 93-638. To reduce the health hazards of involuntary (passive) smoking and to encourage nonsmoking behavior among American Indians and Alaskan Natives, the IHS has established smoke-free environments in its facilities (8-10). These efforts began on February 19, 1985, with a meeting between IHS representatives and the Surgeon General of the United States to discuss plans for a ""Smoke-Free IHS."" To be considered smoke-free, an IHS facility must have no designated smoking rooms for staff, patients, or visitors. In late 1983, the PHS Indian Hospital on the Hopi Reservation at Keams Canyon, Arizona, became the first to reach this goal (9). Now, virtually all IHS facilities have become smoke-free In addition, this initiative led to a smoke-free policy in the American Indian schools on the Navajo Reservation at Zuni, New Mexico The IHS has taken steps to evaluate the impact of its policy on smoking behavior. For example, results of a survey conducted in the Rapid City PHS Indian Hospital in December 1985 suggest that daily cigarette consumption decreased after implementation of a smoke-free policy.

Weinberg ‘Two independent lines of work, each pursuing cellular oncogenes, have con- verged over the last several years. Ini- ally, the two research areas confronted problems that were ostensibly uncon- ected. The first focused on the mecha nisms by which a variety of animal reo. viruses are able. to transform infected ‘mechanisms responsible for tumors of soaviral origin, such as those human ‘uumors traceable to chemical causes. We pow realize that common molecular de- ‘erminants may be responsible for ni mors of both classes. These determi- ‘ant, the cellular oncogenes, constitute a functionally, heterogeneous group of ‘genes, members of which may cooperate ‘with ove another in order to achieve the transformation of cells.

"Los ANGELES BUSINESS JOURNAL Paice $3 Fepnuany 10-16, 1997 Reaching Spanish readers LA.’s Latino market is growing fast, and advertisers are beginning to take notice WADE DANIELS—Contributing Reporter With Spanish-language radio leading local ratings and Spanish-language KMEX Channel 34 broadcasting Southern California's most-watched tele- vision news, ever-growing numbers of advertisers are buying ai time on Spanish language stations. However, too few advertising dollars are ‘lowing into Spanish-language print media, according to JSA Publishing Ine., which is ‘working to capitalize on that situation “Too many advertisers assume Hispanics and immigrants can’t read,” suid Marcelino Miyares Jt, president of JSA En Espail, a division of the Santa Monica-based publish cer and producer of two national Spanish-lan- guage magazines. “We have the data hat says 80 percent of Latinos and immigrants are literate? Each month, JSA En Espanol goes to 1.2 rillion doors, natidnwide with copies of Hogarama and Mundo Deportivo, a home- ‘maker magazine and sports magazine, respectively. “What really sets the magazine apart are their educational context,” suid Miyares. “We're not the only way to reach a lotof peo- ple in this market, but we reach them in an ‘educational context that adds meaning to the communication.” “Miyares says the magazines aim to famil~ iarize their readers with the differences between American consumerism and that of their homeland. Hogarama, for example, shows readers which American products to use in preparing ‘Mexican dishes, as well as how those prod> ‘uts differ from the ones back home. In this ‘way, Miyares sed, immigrants can assimilate ‘while holding on to their cultural identity ‘The strategy appears to be paying off, {ISA's roverwes in 1995 were $5.1 milion, up rom $524,000 in 1990, its frst year in bus ness, That'sa five-year growth rate of 835 per ‘cent, earning ita ranking inthe Inc, $00. SA has not announced its 1996 financial results. ‘Miyares noted that the magazines, unlike ‘many other Spanish-language publications, include only content produced within the United States. Ray Durazo of Durazo ‘Communications Inc, Los Angeles adver. tising consulting firm, agreed that educating new arrivals isa good way for advertisers to appeal to them. Durazo said his company advises clients toinclude practical information about how to use products. ‘Ads for health products with which jmmigrants may not be familiar should include in-depth explanations of their uses and benefits. Bank ads should outline how to tse financial products as basic as checking accounts, which only the upper class uses in Mexico, he said, Leon Potssinsit; media director of La Agencia de Orci & Associates, a Los Angeles-based agency specializing in adver- Using to the Latino market, said Hogarama ‘and Mundo Deportivo are atractve because they offer direct mail advertisers opportunities to get involved in promodonal events that SA. stages in local Hispanic communities. “Another attraction for advertisers seeking significant market penctrations is that the publications are ing on the doorknobs of 1.2 millon houssholds each month in such large metro areas as Los Angeles, (500,000 households), New York, Texas-anywhere the USS. Census Bureau spots a concentration of {foreign-bom Spanish speakers. ‘These companion publications constitute the nation’s Ingest Spanish-language print ‘ehicle delivered to the market segment. And Miyares sid the JSA publications delivery cost to advertisers is one-tenth of normal rece mail rates. Until Hogarama and Mundo Deportivo Potasinski sai, advertisers were limited t0 buying space in publications with small print runs of only a few hundred thousand copies, hardly substantial considering Los ‘Angeles alone has a Hispanic population of 64 million ISA Publishing was founded as a custom publisher in 1990 by Jeff Stem, who earlier founded Details magazine in Now York and sold it to Conde Nast Publications Inc.

Unfortunately, the limited wel ability of most superalloys (Ref. 1) has restricted the application of fusion techniques on structural turbine hardware. Brazing is often utilized to join these ma- terials and thus avoid fusion cracking problems. How- ever, there are many applications for which superalloy brazements do not possess adequate elevated temper- ‘ature mechanical or physical properties. ‘Another method which has shown promise for join- ing superalloys is solid state diffusion bonding. Al- though these materials are more difficult to join by process than some other alloy families (e.g. titanium, iron), methods have been developed for producing ex- cellent solid state diffusion bonds in both precipitation strengthened Ref. 2) and dispersion strengthened (Ret. 3) nickel alloys. This approach is attractive for some component shapes, but the need for high bonding pres- sures (e.g, 500-000 psi), exacting mating surface preparation and fit-up, and some deformation in the parts during bonding can make the process uneconom- ical in many situations. Also, when fabricating parts of ‘complex geometries, it may be impossible to apply bonding pressure uniformly to the mating surfaces ‘even with expensive and elaborate tooling. ‘Anew process (Ref. 4) has recently been developed to alleviate these difficulties and permit the diffusion bonding of nickel base superalloys without the need for substantial bonding pressure. With this process, called ‘TLP bonding, bonds with strengths equivalent to base ‘metal values can be achieved in a variety of similar and dissimilar alloy combinations. Complex shaped paris can be joined using simple tooling and mating surface preparation. Also, bonding is conducted in conven: tional vacuum or argon heat treating furnaces to permit large numbers of parts to be economically joined in each process cycle. ‘TLP Bonding Nature ofthe Process The basic details of the new process are shown in Fig. 1. thin (¢.g,, 0.001-0,004 in.) interlayer alloy of specific composition a img-point is used as a bonding agent.

MALKUS *, P, BUSCHBAUM and A. CASTRO Depertment of Pethology, University of Miami, Miami, Florida 93182 (US.A.) (Received April 6th, 1978) Summary ‘A turbidimetric rate method for the determination of immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, and IgM has been adapted to an automatic kinetic rate analyzer. The pro- cedure can be run on mildly lipemic sera without correction for sample light scatter. We report correlations with results by an immunodiffusion method and a manual laser nephelometric technique. The automated rate procedure C described provides a rapid, accurate, precise and sensitive way to measure immunoglobulins. immunogen Introduction During the past few years there has been considerable clinical interest in developing convenient automated analyses for specific immunoglobulins [1,2]. Although the precipitin reaction was first identified by Krauss in 1897 [3] and ‘the manual nephelometzic quantitative analysis of specific proteins was described by Libby in 1938 [4,5], it has been the recent commercial availability of high quality monospecific antiserum that has led to the development of automated nephelometrie and turbidimetric analyses. The automated equilib- rium techniques developed on continuous flow instrumentation [6,7] and cen- trifugal analyzers [8,9] all require sample blanks due to nonspecific light scat- ter. In an‘attempt to correct for sample induced light scatter a reaction rate analyzer was adapted using an early post mixing reading [10]. A rate method of detecting antibody immunoglobulin complexes was developed on a centri- fugal analyzer modified with a laser for light scatter measurements (11—14]. ‘We have adapted the rate technique which offers the advantage of automatic blank correction to the Perkin Elmer KA-150 kinetic analyzer. The method described here gives excellent sensitivity and a large working range for immuno- gobylins IgG, IgA and IgM. ‘whom correspondence should be addresied.",6

"MAMS MAIL [ October 7, 1994 To: 8. G. Hanes From: Diane M. Lewis SUBJECT: SEPTEMBER STATUS REPORT Dear Glenn: ‘The Southern California Region's activities during September centered around Full Price share protection, 299 account penetration and Savings. Full Price Share Protection All divisions continued working the market average approach to full price share protection with minor adjustments; $3.00 on base Winston and Camel, $4.00 on Select only and the elimination of Salem. In addition, we ran Camel carton promotions in Food-4-Less and Smith's, and Winston carton promotions in Hughes, Stater Bros., Price/Costco and Vons. The results have been extremely Positive. Winston and Camel shipments for August and September increased over the June and July period. Effective 9/26 all retail and chain divisions were given a weekly budget for the balance of 1994, and per Y.W. Ford's letter, we are switching from the market ‘approach to a true 35¢ gap approach. During work-withs this week and last ‘week | stressed with division managers that this program must be more flighted ow and in 1995 to gain impact and stay within budgets. To date competition has not reacted to our full price protection. PM continues to utilize flex funds in selacted accounts to promote Marlboro at 20-25¢ off and B&W is still working 40¢ off on Kool. g 3",0

Reduction of the level of smoking has become a major public heaith issue i recent years The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of two policy instruments which may be employed by governments to reduce per capita cigarette consumption: taxation and antimoking publicity. Time series cigarette sales data for Switzerland between 1954 and 1981 are analyecd. Several hypotheses are tested about how taxation and publicity have influenced cigarette demand. In particular, the study focuses’ on longcterm ‘effects of publicity, on indirect effects between publicity and taxation, aed on the ‘relative importance of the two policy instruments as deterents of Cigarette consumption. The results imply that anti-smoking publicity did have a substantial permanent impact and that there were important indirect effects between publicity and taxation.

Likewise cleavage of a protein by a reagent bound at a particular site could give information about the folding of the polypeptide chain? Fora protein cleavage method, several criteria must be met Reagents capable of cleaving peptide bonds and suitable for at- tachment at specific sites must be devised. If peptides are wo be identified by standard sequencing procedures, conditions must be found under which cleavage of the polypeptide backbone pre- dominates over degradation of amino acid side chains, producing fragments with free amino and carboxyl termini. Cleavage re- actions should occur at oF near physiological conditions of pl, temperature, and ione strength. Generally, it wil be preferred thatthe chain not be cleaved atthe amino acid residue carrying the cleaving reagent but rather at sites that are nearby in the thee-dimensionel structure (though posibly distant inthe primary sequence. achieved this by introducing a metal-binding site at cone poston in a polypepie chain. We attached an iron chelate {o8 unique residue on the protein bovine serum albumin (BSA), treated the proten-chelate conjugate with HO, ascorbate, and observed the production of three peptide fragments which together account for the entire polypeptide chain. ‘The experimental procedure is outlined in Figure 1.

"JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF TOXICOLOGY Volume 9, Namber§, 1990, MaryAnn Liberte, Publishers Triethylene Glycol Ethers: Evaluations of In Vitro Absorption Through Human Epidermis, 21-Day Dermal Toxicity in Rabbits, and a Developmental Toxicity Screen in Rats ‘A. PHILIP LEBER,"" R.C. SCOTT,? M.C.E. HODGE,’ D. JOHNSON, * and WJ. KRASAVAGE* ABSTRACT ‘The methyl, ethyl, and butyl ethers of triethylene glycol (TM, TE, and TB, respectively) were evaluated in three screening studies to assess their potential hazards to humans. The assessments included (1) an in vitro procedure to determine the ability of the materials to penetrate human skin, (2) 21-day dermal limit test in rabbits to determine potential systemic toxicities, and (3) a screening procedure to evaluate the chemicals’ potentials to induce developmental toxicity. In the in vitro dermal absorption procedure, the three test materials crossed human epidermis at ‘molar rates 170-330 times more slowly than the lower molecular weight homolog ethylene glycol ‘methyl ether (EM), a chemical known to induce systemic eects folowing skin application. In the 21-day dermal study, daily applications of 1000 mg/kg TM, TE, or TB did not produce systemic toxicity in male or female rabbits, including hematologic or testicular effects. The low dermal penetration rate of the triethylene glycol ethers may have played a role inthis outcome. In the developmental toxicity screening test, oral doses of 1000 mg/kg given on Days 6-15 of gestation did not produce maternal toxicity in rats and had no effect on viability or growth of offspring, pre- or postnatally, indicating low developmental toxic potential for these compounds. The resulls ofthese studies indicate that triethylene glycol methyl, ethyl, and butyl ethers have very low capacities tobe absorbed through the skin of exposed individuals, low potentials to produce systemic toxicity following oral or dermal exposures, and do not appear to be selectively toxic to the developing conceptus. The data clearly indicate that triethylene glycol ethers do not exhibit toxicologic profiles comparable to those ofthe methyl and ethyl ethers of ethylene glycol.

Evidence for paracrine growin hibitors ang intracellular growth suppressors is accumu: lating. Proposed or confirmed examples ofthis class of ‘molecules include secretary palypemtide growin inhibitors lik transtorming growth factor 6 (TGF-8) and nuclear phos- ‘phoprotans like tne retinoblastoma gene product. A ques tion that arises as different types of growth suppressors 19 identi is whetner they could be part of com- ‘mon growth.innibitory pathways. TGF. is a paracrine polypeptide found ubiquitously in vertebrates, and protoiypic ofa large family of metazoan Growth, citferontiation, and morphogenesis factors (lor Feviews see Massagué, 1987, 1990; Roberts ang Spor, 1980). Wnin nis family, ta TOFS group incluces atleast three highly homologous genes (TGF-I, TGF-82, TOF63) present In humans and cther mammals, with additional ‘Genes prosontin avian and ampnibian genomes (Osrynck al, 1885: Hanks ot al, 1968; ton Oj ot al, 1988; Lakoinlew ot al., 1988). Al TGES forms tested diay {rowth.nhibtory activity in normal or transformed epith I, endothelial, fibroblast, neuronal, lymphoid, and he ‘matopoitic cell types (Tucker etal, 1984; Moses eal. 1985; Roverts ot al, 1885; Kehr! ot al., 1986; Fre 50502604 Schroder ot al, 1288, Ohta ot al, 1987; Kimehi at a. 1988). Tho extont of the growth.inhibitory response to TOFS varies by call type, with lung epitnelial calls and keratinooy!es showing the strongest response, @ virtual ‘growth arrest (Tucker ot al, 1984; Shipley etl. 1986). Un- {er certain conditions, txoblast cal lines and osteoblasts ‘can be mitogenicaiy stimulated by TGF, and in some f- Droblasts this response appears to be secondary to pro: ucton o! autocrine mitegans (Shipley et al., 1985: Leot etal. 1986; Centrela tal, 1987) In adaition to hese ef- fects on col! proltration, TGF can positively or nega- tively affect the citferentiaton process or the expression of differentiated functions in colls of soveral lineages (Massague. 1930; Roberts and Sporn, 1990). Physiclog Cally, TGF 's implicated in morphogenesis, issue repair processes, anc fibrotic disorders. Some o! these actions ‘may result in part trom tne abilty of TGF.) to regulate the expression of maitipie extracelisiar matrix proteins (ignotz fand Massagué, 1936; Roberts et a, 1985: Laiho at al. 1986) and cai! acresion receptors (Ignetz and Massagud, 1987; Heino et a. °969). The mechanism of growth inhibition by TOFD is vr- wally unknown. inhibited expression of growth-related genes (mc, XC. JE) by TGFB appears to play an impor. lant rte n certain endothelial. carcinoma, and keratino- ‘70 els (Takonara tal, 1987; Farnander-Pol etal, 187, Coffey et a, 1988) but notin fibcoblasts (Chambard and Pouyssegur, 1988; Sorrentino and Bandyopachysy, 1989) ‘The etfects of TGF on jun proto-oncogene expression do ‘ot se0m to correlate with elfects on eal proliferation (Per- tovaara etal, 1989).

A basic requirement for such experi- ‘ments is the administration of cigarette amoke to the experimental ‘method simulating the mechanisms of human ciga- as closely as possible. In most experiments unnatural methods have been used such as tracheal fistulas, smohe-filled chamnbers resulting in nasal rather than oral inhalation of smoke, and anesthetized animals, A method was developed in this lab- oratory 0 facili ion of cigarette smoke by beagle dogs to test the effect of smoking on clearance of inhaled radio- active particles (2). Because this technique is being applied in more extensive studies, it was desirable t© obtain further quanti- ‘ative data on the inhalation and deposition of smoke constituents in the dog. Preliminary experiments showed that cigaretie smoke can be labeled with ""Br, #Na, and €K by prior exposure of the cigarette te neutron radiation. This raised the question whether these ra~ Sionuclides could be-detected in experimental animals smoking neutron activated cigarettes. A series of experiments was initiated of which a representative example is described in detail ‘The smoking system for dogs has been previously. (8). In summary, the system comprises a face mask with a ciga- reite holder, valves, and an electronic control system. The mask ‘contains a flattened polyethylene tube which extends 3.8.cm into the dog's mouth, through which both air and smoke are inhaled. : «0 ‘athinglon 99352 ‘The control system regulates frequency and. volume of the ciga- reite smoke introduced into the mask, The dog, wearing the face mask with the burning cigarette inserted in the cigarette holder, inhales fresh aie through a solenoid valve connected to the flat ‘ened polyethylene tube inseried in the dog's mouth.

FISCHER, S.R. WAGLE* and N.R. KATZ Institut fir Biochemie der Universitaet, Hunboldtallee 7, D-3400 GBttingen, PRG Received August 22, 1983 The coll number as well as the hexokinase and glucokinase activity of liver parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells were studied in metha~ Pyrilene treated rats. The ntmber of nonparenchymal cells was doubled after treatment with methapyrilenc for two weeks while that of hepa= tocytes remained constant. The hexokinase activity was increased fourfold in the nonparenchymal cell fraction while it was unchanged in the parenchymal cells. The glucokinase activity was decreased in the hepatocytes to one third. Hence, the increased hexokinase acti- vity was due to a proliferation of nonparenchymal cells rather than to a toxic dedifferentiation of hepatocytes. = The antihistaminic drug methapyrilene was used therapeutically until its carcinogenic potency was recognized a few years ago. After long-term administration to rats hepatocelluler carcinomas develop (1). However, long before preneoplastic foci occur, toxic alterations are observed mainly in the periportal zone of the liver acinus (2). These morphological changes are accompanied by an inversion of the metabolic zonation, which is indicated by an increase in hexokinase (Bc 2.7.1.1) in the periportal zone and decrease of glucokinase (Bc 2.7.1.2) in the perivenous zone of the liver acinus (2). How ever, no conclusive information is available, whether the increase of hexokinase is due to parenchymal (PC) or to nonparenchymal cells (eC). Therefore, in the present study, the hexokinase and the gluco- kinase activities were determined in parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells separated tro livers of methapyrilene treated animals. the hexokinase was increased fourfold in the nonparenchymal cell fraction by enhancement of the nonparenchymal cell number as well as by an Ancrease of the collular level of the enzyme. On the other hand the hexokinase activity present in parenchymal cells was not changed throughout the experiment, while the glucokinase activity was sig- nificantly reduced. “Visiting senior Fulbright guest professor from Dept. of Pharmacology, Indiana University, School of Medicine, Indianapolis, USA 0006-2914/83 $1.50 Copyright © 1983 by Academic Pres, In Allrighs of reproduction in any form reserved. 1090 50279149",6

"406 Differential Desensitization of A, Adenosine Receptor-Mediated Inhibition of Cardiac Myocyte Contractility and Adenylate Cyclase Activity Relation to the Regulation of Receptor Affinity and Density Bruce T. Liang and Leslie A. Donovan Effects of chronic exposure of cultured atrial myocytes to R-N*-(2-phenylisopropyl)-adenosine (APIA) on the A, adenosine receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and myocyte contractility were examined. Chronic exposure of atrial myocytes cultured trom 14-day-old chick embryos to R-PIA desensitized the myocyte to the inhibitory effects of R-PIA, ‘on contractility and adenylate cyclase activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Desensitization of the negative inotropic response was only partial, whereas the adenosine receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity was almost completely absent after 24 hours of R-PIA (1 1M) exposure, Furthermore, the contractile response to K-PIA desensitized ‘more slowly than the desensitization of A, adenosine receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase (f;;=11.4:0.7 hours versus 7.5:+1 hours, mean SEM, n=12 and 6, respectively). Thus, the two A, adenosine receptor-tinked functional responses desensitized differently in response to chronic exposure of the myocyte to R-PIA. Binding of the antagonist radioligand ['H)- 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (UHICPX) in membranes from myocytes preexposed to R-PIA demonstrated a time-dependent decrease in receptor density without any change in the affinity for the antagonist radioligand. Computer analyses of agonist competition with ['H]CPX binding in membranes from control and R-PIA-treated myocytes revealed a conversion of the high-affinity A, adenosine receptor to a low-affinity form such that after 24 hours of 1 M R-PIA ‘exposure, all of the receptors were in a low-affinity form, On the other hand, downregulation of the receptor was partial, with nearly 60% of the receptor remaining after 24-hour treatment with 1 4M R-PIA. These data indicate that the mechanism of desensitization of the A, adenosine receptor-mediated negative inotropic response differs from that of the desensitiza- tion of the adenylate cyclase. Uncoupling of the A, adenosine receptor from a high-affinity state ‘was closely associated with desensitization of the inhibition of adenylate cyclase; downregula- tion of the A; adenosine receptor appeared to parallel desensitization of the negative inotropic response, (Cireulation Research 1990;67:406~414) | { ardiac actions of adenosine are mediated by specific adenosine receptors of the A, sub- type located on the surface of cardiac yocytes.?

"Smoking and Pregnancy ERNEST L. ABEL, PH.D. ‘The harmful effects of smoking on the developing _ child were commented on as eatly 2s the seventeenth, fentury by no less an authority than Francis Bacom, Beneraly credited with introducing modern scientific methodology, Bacon remarked that just at a preguant woman's diet could be expected to affect het ustom shild, s0 too could tobacco be expected ko alter the <hild's development (Bacon 1626). A few yeats later in 1669, Dr. E. Maynwaring, a prominent London physi, cian, condemned tobacco outright because ofits advene sffects on the conceptus. Tobacco, he wrote, “causeth 0 unfirm generation, by debilitating the parents. and makes a diseased issue” (Brooks 1937). In other parts of Europe, there was also considerable concem expressed about the possible damage to pregaant women from smoking. tn Holland, a Dutch author wrote in 1692 that there was no doubr whatsoever that smoking could exwse tmssearnages, and in 1698, the townspeople of Sarsgosa Spain, petitioned the Spanish Tobacco. Monepoly Administration to ceconsidet its plan to erect a tobacco factory in the arca because of the postibilty that odors from the factory might endanger pregnant women (Brooks 1937), ‘The catliest clinical study to direct contemporary medical attention to the possibly harmful effeets of Smoking on the developing fetus was Sontag and Wallace's repore (1935) that maternal smoking produced A “definite and real” increase in the heact rate.

The first such study was reported by Simpson (1957) and was based on a study of over 7,000 women in California, Simpson found that the incidence of low bicth weight (< 2,500 ) was almost twice as Breat among women who smoked as it was among onsmokers, In addition, she noted that the incidence of low birth weight was dose related to the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Two years ater, Lowe (1959) documented 2 similar relation between smoking and birth weighe in England and showed thac this telation as not mediated by indirect effects, such as mateenal age, parity and prepregnant weigh. This review article will summarize current knowl: ‘edge about the proven and suggestive effects of maternal smoking during pregraney on embryo/fetal, neonatal and postneonatal outcomes. Some of the controversies concerning interpretation of these data will also be oted and, finally, efforts at identifying the mechs nisms) by which smoking produces ics effeces will be examined.

"R. Cox TWELVE PACK CONSUMER RESEARCH MANAGEMENT SUMMARY This sunnarizes implications of the quantitative research conducted to determine reaction to the twelve pack. 1, The twelve pack generated relatively low, and predominately only occas- ional, purchase. Specifically, 4.6% of smokers in outlets where the twelve packs were available bought the twelve pack, and 90% viewed this package as only an occasional purchase. Because of this, the up- side potential for twelve pack appears limited and should not be viewed as sonething that would generate substantial incremental volume. 2. The twelve pack is not seen as a bargain. Over 80% of the buyers and about 90% of the aware non-triers saw this as a “worse buy”. Because of this the hypothesis that this pack could do particularly well in econonically depressed areas does not appear to hold true. 3. Among purchasers there was a good level of competitive trial and trial anong young adults (particularly men). Because of this, the twelve pack could be a useful promotional device (even if we charge for it). A report with detailed findings is attached. Mi Cox Marketing Development Department ARC/ pm.

A aumber of reports on the effects of cigarette smoke induced by smokers ina confined space or by smoking machines in chambers have shown an increased incidence of subjective symptoms such as headaches and ievtation ofthe eyes and respiratory passages (Johansson and Ronge. 1965: Edito- Fal. 1974: Rylander, 1974: Schmidt. 1974, Weber et wl., 1976). However. rela- tively little is known of systemic effects of various concentrations of ambient cigarette smoke on maa or animals. Previous studies have shown that exposure to ‘environmental stresses caused chnges in blood chemistry and changes in body temperature that aided in the diagnosis of the severity of stresses (Selye, 1950: Highman and Aland, 1962, 1966; Hess. 1963: Garbus ef w.. 1968). No such studies have been reported on the acute effects of increasing concentrations of tobacco smoke. Consequently we have determined the effects of different amounts of cigarette smoke on changes in plasma lactic dehydrogenase and creatine kinase of rats which were maintained for 4 hours at rest or after light exercise. We have also determined the effects of smoke upon body weight and temperature, blood lactic and pyruvic acids. blood glucose, plasma corticos- terone, and tissue changes. 1 0013.9351/70151-140602.090 spo Wb ete 86895zE9",6

Gross* Columbia University. School of Public Heath. 600 West 168 Street, New York, NY 10032 and ‘Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425. U.S.A, Received in reised form 29 August 1990) Abstract—Meta-analysis, a set of statistical tools for combining and integrating the results of independent studies of a given scientific issue, can be useful when the stringent conditions under which such integration is valid are met. In this report we point out the dificuties in obtaining sound meta-analyses of either controlled clinical trials or epidemiological studies. We demonstrate that hastily or improperly designed meta- ‘analyses can lead to results that may not be scientifically valid. We note that much care is typically taken when meta-analysis is applied to the results of clinileal trials. The Food and Drug Administration, for example, requires strict adherence to the principles we discuss in this paper before it allows a drug's sponsor to use a meta-analysis of separate clinical studies in support of a New Drug Application. ‘Such care does not always carry over to epidemiological studies, as demonstrated by the 1986 report of the National Research Council concerning the purported association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and the risk of tung cancer. On the basis of a meta-analysis of 13 studies, 10 of which were retrospective and the remaining 3 prospective in nature, the Council concluded that non-smokers who are exposed to fenviconmental tobacco smoke are at greater risk of acquiring lung cancer than rhon-smokers not so exposed. In our opinion. this conclusion in unwarranted given the poor quality of the studies on which itis based, 1, INTRODUCTION yes.” The criteria for reaching this affirmative answer are now considered. In applications of meta-analysis to clinical trials, the following questions, among many other that must be addressed, arise. ‘A working definition of meta-analysis is given by Huque [I]: “...the term “meta-analysis! refers to a statistical analysis which combines or integrates the results of several independent inical trials, considered by the analyst to be ‘combinable’.” As indicated by this characteriz~ @ Are all studies to be included in the meta- analysis. or only the published ones? ation of meta-analysis, its key application is to be found in the analysis and synthesis of data from clinical trials. The question then remains, can meta-analytic techniques be applied in the analysis of other kinds of data such as those that arise in cohort and case-control studies found in epidemiol- ogy? The answer to this question is a guarded crue ut ‘ Are all published studies to be included in the meta-analysis, or only the “good” ones? & ‘When the studies’ results are hetero-> geneous, how may they be included in a meta-analysis, or should they be meta-ana-£> lyzed at all?

Ido not ‘doubt your intentions, but growers are not reassured by the siruation they find domestic tobacco production in today. TLze Tests Prior to 1970, very litle burley tobacco was imported into this country. Today, foreign burley makes up one-third of the totel volume which goes into ‘manufacturing. Thos enclosed a chart which demonstrates just how dramatically imports have soared. JAS you can see, the coral amount of all unmanufacrured tohacco imported for consumption during the first five months of 1993 is over 188,000 metric tons, This is quivaieat to the average anmutal total imports for the period 1987 « 1991. Importers paid nearly $600 million for foreign grown tobacco over one-balf of which directly displaced domestic flue-cured and burley tobacco usage. | find the present situation very discouraging. While 1 wish this issue could be Terolved without legislation, few other options exist, Kentucky burley farmers suffered 5 mullion pound drop in the 1993 basic quota, due largely to the decline in manufacturer purchase intentions. Since 1991, burley tobacco purchases have failen by one-third: and this represents a direct loss of nearly $200 million in farm income Kentucky burley growers, Without the provision which Yimited the decline in quota to 10 percent, the basic quota would have fallen more than 22 percent this year If chere is not 2 significant increase in manufacrurers purchase intentions for 1994, Kennucky Surley producers will suffer another major cut in income and Kentucky farming communities will suffer. We ‘have reached the point where something must be done to protect tobacco quota holders. 68 ane wits pov nen rer",0

Mason*?, Dominic Man-Krr Last#, anp CHARLES J. ARNTZE “agra Ine. 10 Hawthorn, Comoe, TX 70: Nasiat of Biosiences and Techology, Cents fr unt techie, Teas ABM University Howson, TX 770903303 Contributed by Charles J. Arntzen, September 16,1992 ABSTRACT Tobacco plants were genetically transformed with the gene encoding hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg) linked to a nominally constitutive promoter. Enzyme-linked Immunoassays using a monoclonal antibody directed against hboman serum-derived HBsAg revealed the presence of HBsAg im extracts of transformed leaves at levels that correlated with ‘mRNA abundance. This suggests that there were no major ‘inherent limitations of transcription or translation of this foreign gene in plans. Recombinant HBsAg was purified from ‘transgenic plants by immunoaffinity chromatography and ex- amined by electron microscopy. Spherical particles with an average diameter of 22 nm were observed in negatively stained preparations. Sedimentation of transgenic plant extracts in swerose and cesium chloride density gradients showed that the recombinant HBsAg and human seruoderived HBsAg had similar physical properties. Because the HBsAg produced in transgenic plants is antigenically and physically similar to the HBsAg particles derived from human serum and recombinant ‘yeast, which are used as vaccines, we conclude that transgenic plants hold promise as low-cost vaceine production systems, Hepatitis B virus infection is one of the most widespread viral infections of humans and causes acute and chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (1). The infectious viral particle (Dane particle) isa 43-nm double-shelled sphere that consists of a core containing the 3.2-kilobase (kb) DNA genome ‘bound to the core protein, surrounded by the viral envelope containing phospholipids and the major surface antigen [hep- atitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)] (2). In addition to Dane particles, the serum of infected individuals also contains 22-nm subbvral particles in great excess over virions. These ‘noninfectious particles contain the elements of the viral envelope, including the major 24-kDa peptide that occurs in alycosylated and unglycosylated forms (2). ‘Because the host range of hepatitis B virus is limited to humans and chimpanzees, and since the virus cannot be propagated in cell culture, HBsAg for use in vaccines was purified from the serum of infected ingividuals until a recom- binant form (rHBsAg) was produced in yeast (3). The immu: nogenic yeast-derived rHBsAg occurs in the form of spher ical particles with an average diameter of 17 nm. Integration ‘of the peptides into the phospholipid-containing particles greatly enhances their immunogenic properties (4). Subse- quent work showed that the peptides present in the yeast derived particles were much less extensively disulfide-linked than ia the human material but that such linking could be induced in vitro (5). Intramuscular injection of serum-derived HBsAg or yeast- derived rHBsAg in healthy individuals results in effective immunization and protection from viral infection (6, 7). In ‘many areas of the developing world, however, the expense of imanization programs for large segments of the population “The publication costs of his atte were defayed in part by page charge payment. This article mst therefore be hereby marked ""adveiement In accordance with 18 U-S.C. 1738 solely 1 nda ths fc. ums ‘erech Indust, Ci, 10 asthorm, Cone, TX 77301 is prohibitive, ‘his has led us to attempt the expression of HBsAg in plants vith the hope of developing a less expen- sive production system. Further, we hope to find a way to present the rHBsAx in edible plant tissues in a form that ‘would be useful as un oral vaccine. In this paper we describe the transformation of bacco withthe gene encoding HBsAg and its expression in leaf tissue in the form of an antigenic spherical particle with an average diameter of 22 am. This plant-derived rHBsAg is directly analogous to the rHBsAg from yeast that is now used for commercial vaccines. We view this as a successful first step in a long-term project dedicated to developing technologies for low cost “edible vaccines” for the developing work. MATERIALS AND METHODS Construction of Plasmids for Plant Transformation. The HBsAg coding region on the Pst 1/Hindlll fragment from PMT-SA (kindly provided by Liche Guo, Chinese Academy fof Sciences) was subcloned into pBluescript KS (Stratagene) to form pKS-HBS. The HBsAg gene in pKS-HBS was ‘opened 116 base pairs (bp) 3 to the termination codon with BsiBI and the resalting ends were blunted by filing with Klenow enzyme und dCTP/AGTP. The entire coding region was then excised 16 bp upstream ofthe PstI site with BamHI pBII21 (ref. 8; obtained from Clontech) was digested with Sac I and the ends were blunted with mung bean nuclease ‘The GUS coding region was then released with Bamlil and the vector was isolated. The HBsAg coding fragment was ligated into the GUS-less pBI21 to yield pHBIO1 (Fig. 1), where its expression is driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) promoter derived from pBI21, ‘The CaMV 355 promoter with duplicated enhancer linked to the tobacco eich virus (TEV) 5* nontransiated leader sequence, which acts as a translational enhancer (9), was excised from pRTT 2-GUS (10) as follows. pRTL2-GUS was digested with Neo { and the ends were blunted with mung bean nuclease. The promoter-leader fragment was then re- leased by digestion with HindIMl, pHBIOI was digested with HindIT and Sma Lo release the 35S promoter fragment, and the vector was purified. The promoter-leader fragment was then ligated into the MindI1I/Sma T-digested pHB101 to yield pHB102 (Fig. 1). {he HBsAg coding region lies upstream of the nopaline synthase terminator in both constructs. The plasmids contain the left and right border regions, which denote the limirs o the DNA that is integrated into the plant ‘genomic DNA via Agrohacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation, ss well as the neomycin phosphotransterase zene, which allows selection with kanamycin Plant Transformation.

Recently two lines of evidence have implicated that cellular heat shock proteins (hap) ray pay «role in steroid hormonal regulation of target tissues, One i the demonstration that cellular 90K tp (hsp-90) can complex with steroid recep tors in vitro and inhibit their ability to interact with DNA, and second, the demonstration that in wan oviduct ex steroids can ‘regulate the synthesis ofhsp-108.

In these studies we have exatined the estrogenic wish General Hospital, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, ‘reduces the uterine concentration of hp-90, and estradiol causes ‘time-dependent increas in uterine hap-90 as eary as 4h afer steroid edministation, reaching a maximum increase of 411d Detween 18-26 h, The effect is specific to estrogens and not lite by other steroid hormones, Its also target isu specific uch that itis seen with uterus end vagina ad does not occu in nontarget tissue for estradiol, such as pleen. The posable Dhyiological significance of estiogenic stimulation of uterine ‘hsp-90 has been discussed.

The classical inducers of these proteins in eukaryotic cells are elevation in temperature (heat), heavy metals, alco- hol, and glucose starvation. The precise function of these proteins is not known, but overall they are thought to be intimately involved in maintaining tissue homeostasis, Recently, one of the stress proteins, the 90K heat shock protein (hsp-90) has received considerable attention with regard to its possible role in regulating steroid hormone action in target tissues. A cellular hsp-90 has been shown to be associated with a variety of molybdate-stabilized nonactivated steroid-receptor complexes (3, 4), and this association has been found to be responsible for main- taining the receptor in a state unable to interact with DNA in vitro (65, 6). It has also been speculated that hsp- ‘90 may satisfy the criteria for the in vivo cellular protein, responsible for masking the DNA-binding site of the receptor in the absence of steroid (5-8), In addition to the documentation that hsp-90 can complex with steroid receptors in vitro there are two reports which reveal that steroid hormones can regulate the synthesis of hsp.

Similarly, in L929 cells dexamethasone has been shown to augment the synthesis of hsp-90 (10). ‘These observations suggest the possibility that in target tissues for steroids, steroid hormones and cellular hsp-90 may ‘mutually regulate their cellular functions. For the last 2 decades the rodent uterus has been used Widely as a model system for delineating the mechanisin of estrogen action and estrogen receptors in mammalian cells. Therefore, it seemed plausible to us that an exam. ination of the potential relationship between estrogen action and cellular hsp-90 in mouse uterine tissue may Provide us with certain insights concerning the possible cellular function of hsp-90. Accordingly, we have exam- ined the steroid hormonal regulation of hsp-90 in mouse uterus and report that estradiol increases the level of this protein in a steroid- and tissue-specific manner.

"Peer pressure, shmeer pressure. Dont smoke. ~ Tfsome of your friends smoke, and they make you feel like you should smoke, too, that’s “peer pressure.” But even though we're a cigarette company, we think young people shouldn't smoke. Even the decision tosmoke or not tosmoke should wait until youre an adult. ‘So we put together these ideas tohelp you recognize peer pressure—and resist it. Tactic #1:__Go ahead and take a puff-—that’s the matter, are you chicken? Answer: ‘You must think I'm pretty dumb to fall for that one. It takesa lot more guts todo your own thing than to just goalong with the crowd. Tactic Come on, all the cool kids smoke, ‘Maybe the kids who smoke are trying to look cool. But if they realy ‘were cool, maybe they wouldn't have to try so hard. Tactic #3: _Hey, I'm your friend — would I steer you wrong? Answer: Friendsare people who like you for who youare, not for what they want you tobe. If youre really my friend, back off Doyou want everybody to think you're a nerd? ‘Sure [ care what other kids think of me. But ifthey base their opinions on stuff like smoking, their opinions aren't worth much. re just scared your parents will find out t blame my parents for geting teed off. How can expect them to treat me like an adult if sneak around and act like akid? ItS natural for you to want to be just like your friends.

"‘Smoking in Adoles.ence A number of articles recently published in pediatric and public health journals have called attention to the rather alarming in- cidence of cigarette smoking in teen-agers and the broader implications of this prac- tice to daily living patterns and life adjust- ment of this group. A recent survey of over 800 adolescents of both sexes disclosed that starting about age 14 or 15, smoking by boys becomes progressively more common until about age 18 when 90 per cent are smoking at least occasionally. The ineidence in girls is somewhat less but at age 18 about 60 per cent are smoking to some degree. Positive associations have been found between rogue Jar or daily smoking and a high frequency of visits to the school health room, frequent absences from classes and a school perform ance of grade C or lower. Smoking does not appear to be causally related but seems more an indication of a way of life. Other factors previously have been de- fined as related to a high incidence of smok- ing in adolescence. Teen-age smokers, in comparison to nonsmokers, spend more time watching TV and going to movies and dances. They are more likely to own ears ? 76 sotume zzzt, number 1 GP TIMN 280238",9

Washington, D.C. 20006 Dear Allan: Tam pleased to advise you that the technical representatives of the sponsors of the Chemosol test program have all approved the protocols described as Y follows: 1, The Hazleton Protocol-Research Proposal No, P-454-102 for carrying out the bioassay test, and 2, The protocol for manufacture of Chemosol treated and control cigarets, dated October 1, 1969. These protocols are contained in the attached copy of the Protocol Subcommittee Report in the form of a letter dated October 2, 1969, with attachments, from Dr. Eldon Nielson, Chairman of the Subcommittee. ‘ It has been agreed for the manufacture of the cigarets that the P. Lorillard ! Company would prepare the strips of tobacco, blended in the proper proportions 4 to match the Kentucky Reference Cigaret formula, and ship them to R. J. Rey- ”! nolds Company in Winston-Salem for treatment and conversion into the finished cigarets. Accordingly, Dr. Murray Senkus, of Reynolds, will name the person , who will act as the industry technical representative in your negotiations with American Chemosol Corporation for the purpose of specifying the conditions of treatment and securing. the certification of the sample, as mentioned in my letter addressed to Mr. Thomas Austern, dated September 26, 1969. Please be reminded of our recommendation that the industry side insist that the American Chemosol Corporation not give any publicity to the submission of these two protocols to them for their examination or to reveal in any way the details of the test program to the public press. We believe that this testing should be done quietly and without fanfare. 1004867152 « BENSON AHEOGES PARLIAMENT PHILIPMORRIG MARLBORO PERSONNABLACES CLARKGUM",0
"Mutagenicity in V79 Chinese hamster cells of n-alkanals produced by lipid peroxidation G.Brambilla, E.Cajell, R.Canonero!, A.Martelii and UM Marinari! Insts of Pharmacology and ‘Gener Paley. Unversity of Gene, Vale Boned Xv. 2. 6132 Gene, aly ‘The mutagenicity for mammalian cells of five nalkanals produced by lipid peroxidation was tested in V79 Chinese hamster lung ‘cells either at the hypoxanthine-guanine _Dhosphorbossitranserase locus as resistance to 6-thioguanine ‘or at the NaiK ATPase locus as resistance to ouabain. The results show that propanal, butanal, pentanal and hexanal induced a dose-dependent increase in the frequency over controls ofboth 6-thioguanine- and ouabain-resstnt mutants a concentrations ranging from 3 t0 30 mM. With aonanal the same effects were observed with concentrations of 01-03 mM. Introduction ‘The demonstrated interaction of lipid peroxidation products with DNA, recently reviewed by Vaca eal, 1988), provides indirect evidence in support of a causal relationship between the free radical-induced  peroxidative breakdown of biomembrane polyunsaturated faty acids and the iniation and/or promotion ‘of carcinogenesis. Concerning the iitiaton phase, this interaction ‘would be of biological significance asa source of mutations. Some ‘of the terminal non-radical products of lipid peroxidation have been found to behave as genotoxic ina variety of short-term tests (Vaca tal, 1988). However, the studies performed until now to assess their mutagenicity in manmalian celis are restricted to malondialdehyde (Yau, 1979) and 4-hydroxynonenal(Cejelli et 4, 1987, whieh have been shown to induce a dose-dependent increase of mutation frequency in LS178Y murine iymphoma cells and in V79 Chinese hamster eels respectively. tn contrast, any information On the mutagenic activity in mammalian cells ‘of the other aldehydes generated by ipd peroxidation is absent. ‘Among them, r-alkanals represent the major elass of non-polar ‘earbonyl compounds obtained from both rat liver microsomes ‘and intact rat hepatocytes peroxidized with ADP-iron or carbon tetrachloride (Esterbauer er al, 1982; Poli et a, 1985), in preliminary experiments evidence has been acquired that Propanal, butanal and hexanal inerease the frequency of ‘hioguanine-resistan mutans in V79 cells, and that the former induces DNA repair synthesis in rat hepatocyte primary cultures Brambilla etal, 1988). The present work was undertaken to compare five n-alkanals-propanal, butanal, pentanal, hexanal and nonanai—for their capability of inducing forward mutations in V79 cells. The two selection systems wsed were the resistance to Gthioguanine and the resistance 10 ouabain, which are considered to compiement each other (Arlt eral, 1978; Bradley eval, 1981), ORL Pres Materials and methods eres ropanal (98% gue, buanal (95 gure, pntanl S8% pre), hexanal 8% reat nasal 28% pure were prc om E Merc (Derm, FR): [yl metanesphonie (EMS) fom ICN Peamscevical Ine (New Yeh) “Nivoso-medylrea (MMU) rom Serva Febcteica Heiberg, FRO) Segue (FO) cutain (UA), racer, ypoeatine ymin ns tipi tom Sigma Chemical Co, (2 Lous, MO), A eer chem, eget Erie, wore ebled from E Merck Mcageniiy says “The Chine ater V79 lng cls dn hi ty were baie rm NU, ‘Corl state or Medi Research (Camden, ND).

The range of effective concentrations was 3~30 mM for propanal, butanal, pentanal and hexanal, and 0.10.3 mM for nonanal.

"February 16, 2000 Mr. Brad Timbes Chevron In response to the questions relayed to us by our Sales Department, I'd like to give you more information about Camel's new “Pleasure to Burn” advertising campaign. ‘The “Pleasure to Burn” campaign is a well-rounded campaign that accurately depicts “the old and new” by mixing contemporary and classic with alittle bit of fun. It celebrates the heritage of the Camel brand yet is relevant to today. It's also an excellent display for retail given its vibrant colors and simple visuals. ‘The “Pleasure to Bum” ads capitalize on the fact that Camel holds a unique position as a cigarette brand which has a rich heritage but also keeps up with the times. The campaign celebrates the decades of Camel's popularity -- reflecting different cultural periods and tastes in our society — but also brings the ads up to date by juxtaposing elements of past eras and contemporary cues. At first glimpse, the ads appear to have a retro feel, but a second look reveals utterly modern elements. For example, a male detective wears a classic hat and trench coat, but sports an earring; and a lady reminiscent of past eras chats on a cell phone. The ads are designed to stand out and deliver a telegraphic and impactful message. It offers us a highly branded format, but in a classic painting style that feels more like art than advertising. The format is designed to translate easily and impactfully to many different media and applications — a variety of sizes, shapes, formats and locations. For example, the graphics would work in a magazine ad, a bar sign, a direct-mail piece, or in retail display. It is important to us in developing advertising that we not only clearly communicate the brand's message in a distinctive way, but we emphasize being sensitive to how consumers might perceive the ad. All of our advertising concepts are presented to an in- house “advertising review panel” to get reactions from average employees who work in various departments outside our sales and marketing areas, and tested with consumer focus groups. Consumer testing showed that the “Pleasure to Burn” ads had very broad appeal among adult smokers of all ages and both genders. In focus groups among male and female adult smokers ranging in age from 21 to fifties, the “Pleasure to Burn” ads got an overwhelmingly positive response from both males and females. They described the ads as “fun,” “upbeat”, nostalgic yet contemporary ~ the elements that capture Camel's personality and image. An article in the New York Times (September 22) described the “Pleasure to Burn” ads as “a playful commemoration of the Camel brand’s history.” Enclosed are samples of some ads from the “Pleasure to Burn” campaign.

The issue at the present time 1s befuddled and the true answer is for the future to decide. The time has come when courage and at solid con- victions, We are reminded of a quotation by Voltaire, “The history of human opinion is scarcely anything more than the history of human errors”. ‘There are many physi cians of the opinion that cigarette smoking is the causative factor; many others, per- haps the majority, hold the opposite opinion, But the stark reality i that no ‘one knows at this time, what influence, if any, cigarette smoking bears in the pres ent-day prevalence of lung cancer in men. ‘We will look, then, at the subject in an unbiased way.

"“American Cancer Society Seeks a Reopening of Hearings on Tobacco” New York Times (06/14/95) P. A16; Collins, Glenn ‘The American Cancer Society called upon Congress on Tuesday to reopen hearings on the nation's tobacco manufactures, saying that the tobacco industry had ""surreptitiously"" obtained its 1979 working papers about tobacco's cancer-causing effects. The allegation came in response to the disclosure last week of the existence of documents revealing that Philip Morris Inc. had conducted 15 years of research on nicotine's effects on the physical and behavioral aspects of smokers. Papers from the cancer society were amiong the documents. Dr. LaMar McGinnis, the society's president, said Tuesday that the society assumed that the tobscco industry's intention was to use the society's data “to help plan their own counter-strategy of dismissing the huge health consequences of tobacco use, and further increase their sales.” Philip Morris attomey Charles R. Wall said the cancer society offered no proof that the papers weren't obtained through legitimate measures. Cancer society spokesman Thomas Brandt countered that a working document on a policy issue would not have been made available to the public until a decision had been made on it, The eancer society said the documents included its draft policy statement on low tar and nicotine cigarettes, dated October 19, 1979, and prepared for a meeting the following month. Brandt said that statement was obtained by the Tobacco Institute several weeks prior to that meeting and \was sent to various tobacco company execuitives.

BACKGROUND: Referencing Procedure Note 94-11R3, an upper limit of 0.5% stem content for the UTI product produced by CRES Tobacco Company at 605-11 was recommended. The 0.5% upper limit specification was based on historical Cardwell Test Method data. A more sensitive Cardwell Stem Test Method has been evaluated which gives better definition of stem content. An investigation/review of Historical (over time) QA capabilities data (CP & CPK data) using the new test method has been completed and utilized as a basis for developing % Stem Content upper reject limit. PRODUCT IMPACT: Since no process change is being implemented, there should not be any negative impact and should provide a higher quality product because of the more sensitive test method. PRODUCT DISPOSITION: Quip out of spec material and re-run through the process. RISK ASSESSMENT: We do not see any risk associated with the proposal at this time, in fact, the more sensitive setup of the Cardwell Test Method will provide a more consistent product.

You've probably heard anti- ‘smoking groups calling for more laws against smoking in public. Because, they say or imply, it’s a ict that smoke causes disease in non-smokers. But the fact is, it simply has never been shown that smoke causes disease in non-smokers. Here's what an eminent doe- tor who was an advisor to the Surgeon General's Committee was quoted as saying in 1976: “In very direct terms there is no med- ical proof that non-smokers ex- posed to cigarette smoke in ordinary relation with smokers suffer any damage.""* There's much more testimony like that. From government agen- cies, other doctors, researchers, medical investigators. Much of it from sources that are strongly against. smoking. Some of it is quoted in the box at the right. Certainly smokers and non- smokers can sometimes annoy one another. But what's needed to solve that problem is more cour- tesy, not more laws.

Intcoduction eLapachone (3.tlitydea-2,2-dimethy-2H-naphthol1.2-b] pyran '6edione) is a naturally occurring product that can be easily obtained fom lapachol, an abundant quinone present in the lapacho tree (Tae: ‘buia avellanedae) native 0 South America (1-3). We demonstrated previously that f-lapachone did not alter the activities of eukaryotic Topo Il: DNA ligises (ll, of HII; or intercalate into DNA (4~7) Brlapactone did, however, specifically ater the activity of Topo I* (4) Althoush or original data indicated that B-lapackone activated Top 12 it was fee independentiy stown by Li er af (8) and DARLDT WeandihE foe MB ons Fa ee Boothtan er a.

To our knowledge, Belapactone is the only known compound that binds directly to Topo and inhibits its enzymatic activity (7, 8). Thus, the apparent activa tion of Topo I observed eatlier (4) probably resulted from a nicking reaction without sabiization of DNA-Topo I complexes (7). Toese data with -lapachone indicated to us that Topo T was involved in [DNA repair and may be exploited after radiation therapy in tumors ‘with elevated levels ofthis enzyme, including melanomas, lung car- tinomas, breast cancers, and colon and prostate cancers (6,9, 10). ‘ince Topo I inhibitors ae known to cause apoptotic reactions (11, 12), we explored f-lapachone-mediated apoptosis in various human, cells. We demonsirate that treatment of human promyelocytic leuke- toia (HL-60) or human prostate (DU-14S, PC, and LNCaP) cancer cells with B-lapachone specifically resulted in blockage of cell evele fprogession at Gy'G, and induced apoptosis.

Tt is suggested that the gpl20 interaction with the nuclear trophic factor-PKC system may impair ' normal gene expression, and thus result in the clinical symptoms associated ‘AIDS infection, = 10% xacense reer, tos Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is considered to be the causative agent in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the viral envelope protein, gpl20, is thought to facilitate viral entry into cells by binding to the surface antigen, T4 (CD4). The T4 antigen has been localized to both lymphocytes and the hippocampus in the brain (1,2). It has been suggested that the pathology associated with HIV is not a direct consequence of viral infection, but rather a result of interaction of gpi20 with T4 receptor sites (34), Interestingly, there is considerable sequence homology between ‘vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and gpi20, (1,2,5) and it has been proposed that VIP and gp120 compete for the same T4 binding sit + (1,2,5,6). Receptors for VIP have been localized to the plasma membrane of lymphocytes (7) and areas within the hippocampus (8), both of which are impaired in AIDS patients. Substantial literature now demonstrates both the presence of receptors for VIP (9) and the enzyme protein kinase C (PKC) in nuclei from a variety of tissues (10-15). ‘The nuclear localization of PKC has been substantiated both immunochemically and biochemically (16,17) and this nuclear poot displays a higher calcium requirement for optimal activation.

Cut in a 3-2 vote were the regula- tions that outlawed smoking in bars and restaurants with more than two employees by May 1, 2000. The new regulations outlaw smoking in other public buildings, ban cigarette vending machines, town, require businesses have a town permit to sell tobacco, limit where stores can display tobacco products and forbid giveaways of tobacco products. Those rules stayed the same, except for an ad- dition that prohibits smoking by ‘minors in restaurants. ‘The change pleased town res- taurant owners while upsetting those ‘who helped draft Bourne's original regulations. “Restaurant people take a big risk and lay their money on the line. To have a bureaucracy come in and tell them they have to do something that's going to hurt their business, ckat's not right.” said George Fianegan of Fimnie's Place on MacArthur Boulevard. “Atleast this will give the business- mena fair shake” Under the bar ban, anmual ex- ceptions would have been allowed if the smoking area of the restaur- ant was no more than 20 percent of the floor space and if the restaur- ant had a ventilation system that could move 60 cubic feet of air per mina por pereninend edebting eet pot eat Holly O'Brien, Program Director for the Cape Cod Regional Te- bacco Control Program, called the vote a grave disappointment and a blow to public health progress. The Tobacco Control Program and a consortium of the boards of health of Cape Cod, Wareham and Nan- tucket created the original draft regulations, which were then tal ‘en'back to the town health boar for local modifications. The defeat, she said, came in because of a concerted effort the tobacco industry to influ tence the board’s opinion. O'Brien provided copies of aie circulated in Bourne before the meeting urg- {ng people to turn out for the meet- ing and “speak out"" for their rights. The original regulations were adopted when the board's mem- bership had dwindled to three members from the five members that normally sit on the board — enough for @ quorum. Since the two-to-one vote, two new members ‘were elected to the board, bringing the body up to full strength and changing the majority. ‘The two new members, Michael Giancola and John Harrington, who authored Wednesday's changes, both said they opposed the regulations during their elec- tion campaigns: “They were one-issue candi- dates and there's so much going on with the health boards,"" O'Brien said. “T hope in two years we can go back to the board of health and ‘convince the new members this is dacsential for public health,” abe oor 06r828190z",9

"6149 Identification of a Cysteine Residue Essential for Activity of Protein Farnesyltransferase Cys®° IS EXPOSED ONLY UPON REMOVAL OF ZINC FROM TH NZYME, Protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) is a zinc met- alloenzyme that performs a post-translational modifica tion on many proteins that is critical for their function. The importance of eysteine residues in FTase activity was investigated using eysteine-specifie reagents. Zine depleted FTase (apo-FTase), but not the holocnzyme, ‘was completely inactivated by treatment with N-othy! maleimide (NEM). Similar effects were detected after treatment of the enzyme with iodoacetamide. The addi tion of zinc to apo-F""Tase protects it from inactivation by NEM. These findings indicated the presence of specific yateine rosidue(s), potentially located at the zine bind: ing site, that are required for FTase activity. We per- formed a selective labeling strategy whereby the eys- teine residues exposed upon removal of zine from the enzyme were modified with (HJNEM. The enzyme so * modified was digested with trypsin, and four labeled fied and sequenced, one peptide Being the major site of labeling and the rema Inbeled to lesser extents. The major labeled peptide con- tained a radiolabeled cysteine residue, Cys”, that is in teins retained the ability to bind farnesy! diphosphate, they were found to have lost essentially all catalytic activity and ability to bind rine. These results indicate that the Cys in the B subunit of FTase plays a critical role in catalysis by the enzyme and is likely to be one of, the residues that directly coordinate the zine atom in this enzyme.

These findings suggested that the procedure ‘could be adapted for selective ex vivo elimination of malig- nantcells,i.¢,,purging of BM in remission prior to autologous transplantation. Key words: Purging — Autologous bone matrow transplantation Photodyoamic therapy Methods for purging neoplastic cells from harvested marrow are being developed to increase the efficacy of autologous ‘bone marrow (BM) transplantation (1-3). One approach is selective photosensitization, using sensitizing compounds and fight radiation (4, 5]. The variety of compounds shown to exert @ photosensitizing effect includes the hematoporphy- ‘ins, phuthlocyanines, and meroeyanines [6-8]. These well- studied fluorescent compounds are taken up preferentially by tumor ceils and undergo photoexcitation when exposed toappropriate nonionizing radiation. We have recently shown, that 12-(L-pyreneytodecanoie acid (P12), fatty acd to which 1 pyrene ring has becn covalently linked, isan eficent and selective photosensitizing agent [9]. Among the various py- rene-containing fatty acids studied, P12 was most effectively transported across the cell membrane and subsequently in- ‘corporated into the cell's neutral-and phospholipids (10, 11}. Celis of different types and stages of maturation were found to vary in their rate of P12 uptake and incorporation {12] Incubation of cells with P12, followed by irradiation with long-wave UV light (LUV) at 366 nm resulted in cellular “ares ofr requ 1: Dt Eibach Depa of Hem cia ei Givers Hospi, PO Bor 300, Jee SU 50588593 toxicity, which was related to the intensity of irradiation as ‘well as fo the rateand extent of P12 uptake [9 13]. The latter could be influenced by modifying the incubation conditions, such as P12 concentration, addition of serum albumin, in- clusion of ronfluorescent fatty acids, or changing the tem- perature (1). Consequently, all these parameters also af- fected pho:osensitization of the cells. The procedure proved tobe efficient in selectively eliminating certain cell types and sparing other, more cesistant cells [9], The higher sensitivity of some undifferentiated leukemic cells, as compared with theiedifercatiated nomleukemic progeny, suggested that this procedure might be utilized for selective elimination af ms lignant cells trom bone marrow prior to autologous trans plaatation In the prosent study, we tested the potential usefulness of P12 as a pursing agent using human leukemic cell ines and normal bone marrow cells as model systems.
